            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The <hi>poſſeſſions</hi> of it are <hi>corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible; Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> are liable to that ruſt which will conſume them.

The howling Wilderneſs is the direct way to the heavenly <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The late Providence which removed your loving and beloved Husband (I hope to Heaven) hath taught you the truth of theſe particulars. The loſs of ſuch a relation muſt needs be a ſore affliction. The nearer the union is, the more difficult the ſeparation. Husband and Wife are <hi>one fleſh,</hi> therefore to part them cannot but be painful; but Grace will help you both to ſubmit to that blow which is ſo grievous to Nature, and to be the better for it.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:100701:4"/>
            <p>It was ſome comfort to me to obſerve your Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>carriage</hi> under ſo great a <hi>croſs.</hi> The hour of <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction</hi> is an hour of <hi>temptation.</hi> Satan loves to fiſh when the Waters are troubled; He would bring us to hard thoughts of God, by the hard things we ſuffer from God; <hi>Touch him, and he will curſe thee to thy face.</hi> In ſuch ſtormy weather ſome Veſſels are caſt away.

But though froſty ſeaſons are hurtful to Weeds, yet they are helpful to good Corn. A ſanctified perſon, like a ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bell, the harder he is ſmitten, the better he ſoundeth. Faith is a ſpecial Antidote againſt the poiſon of the Wicked one. It can read Love in the blackeſt Characters of Divine diſpenſation; as by a Rain-bow we ſee the beautiful image of the Suns light, in the midſt of a dark and wateriſh Cloud. <hi>Gods Rod, like</hi> Jonathans <hi>is dipt in Hony.</hi> Our daily <hi>bread,</hi> and our ſharpeſt <hi>rod</hi> grow upon the ſame <hi>root.</hi> Every beleiver may ſay in affliction, as <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritius,</hi> when his Wife and Children were ſlain be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore his eyes, <hi>Righteous art thou O Lord, and in very faithfulneſs haſt afflicted me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dear Couzen,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since <hi>Gods Rod</hi> hath a voice as well as his <hi>Word,</hi> and like <hi>Moſes</hi> his Rod in <hi>Egipt,</hi> work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>wonders</hi> in, and for his people; Let me beſeech you to hear it, and to know him that hath appointed it. O how highly doth it behove you to labour, that
<pb facs="tcp:100701:5"/> as <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod it may bud and bloſome with the fruits of holineſs.</p>
            <p>Two Leſſons principally God would teach you by it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That <hi>your affections be taken off from Earthly poſſeſſions;</hi> Dying Relations, call for dying af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> doted on <hi>Egypt</hi> as a pallace, God made it an Iron <hi>furnace</hi> to wean them from it, and to make them weary of it. The creature is our <hi>Idol</hi> by nature, we bow down the knees of our ſouls to it, and Worſhip it; but infinite Wiſdom makes it our <hi>grief,</hi> that it may not be our God. When Children fare well abroad, they are mindleſs of home; but when abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſtrangers, they haſten to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. The World is therefore a Purgatory, that it might not be our Paradice. As ſoon as <hi>Laban</hi> frowned on <hi>Jacob,</hi> he talks of returning to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Houſe. Every <hi>rout</hi> the World puts us to, ſounds a retreat to our affections, and calls off our heart from the eager purſuit of theſe wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vanities. <hi>Wilt thou ſet thine eyes upon that which is not,</hi> Prov. 23.5. much leſs thine heart.</p>
            <p>I have read of a young Hermit, who being paſſionately in love with a young Lady, could not by any Art ſuppreſs the fury and violence of that flame, till at laſt being told that ſhe was dead, and had been buried about fourteeen days, he went ſecretly to her Vault, and with the skirt of his Man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le, wiped the moyſture from
<pb facs="tcp:100701:5"/> the Carcaſs, and ſtill at the return of his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation laid it before him; ſaying, <hi>Behold this is the beauty of the Womad which thou didſt ſo much deſire;</hi> And the Man at laſt with that moyſture of the Corps put out the Fire.</p>
            <p>The godlineſs of the World, its whole glory and gallantry is but a curious Picture drawn on Ice, which affords no good footing, for whilſt we are ſtanding on it, we are ſliding from it, and who would lay the ſtreſs of his felicity upon ſo ſlippery a foundation. No wiſe man ever put his chiefeſt goods and riches in ſuch low damp rooms, where they will corrupt and putrifie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hipocrates</hi> affirmeth that <hi>all immoderations are Enemies to the health of the body.</hi> Sure I am, they are to the health of the <hi>ſoul.</hi> The <hi>amity</hi> of the World, is <hi>emnity</hi> againſt God. All the <hi>Water</hi> is little enough to run in the right Channel, therefore none ſhould run <hi>beſide.</hi> The time is ſhort, <hi>uſe the World, as net abuſing it,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That you <hi>chuſe the good part that ſhall never be taken from you.</hi> Mans heart will be fixt on ſomewhat as its hope, and happineſs. God therefore puts out our Candles, takes away Relations, that we may look up to the Sun and eſteem him our chiefeſt portion. When we are Digging and Delving in the Earth to find out con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and comfort, he ſendeth <hi>damps,</hi> purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make us call to be drawn <hi>upward.</hi> Till the Prodigal met with a Famine, he regarded not
<pb facs="tcp:100701:6"/> his Father. If the Waters be <hi>abated,</hi> the <hi>Dove</hi> is apt to wander and defile her ſelf, but when they cover the face of the earth, and allow her no reſt, then ſhe returneth to the Ark.</p>
            <p>I hope there is a good work begun in you, which ſhall be finiſhed at the day of Chriſt. But <hi>every one ſtande h or falleth to their own Maſter.</hi> Get Scripture on your ſide, and you are ſafe for ever. The Romans when they parted from the bones of their Dead friends (for they burnt them,) took their leave in ſuch language, <hi>Vale, Vale, Vale, Noste ordine quo natura permiſerit ſequemur. Farewel, Farewel, Farewel, We ſhall follow thee in the time, and order, which nature alloweth us.</hi> You may ſay of your Husband, as <hi>David</hi> of his <hi>Child, I ſhall go to him, but he ſhall not return to me.</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare therefore for your dying hour.</p>
            <p>Labour to be <hi>rich</hi> in godlineſs; Grace alone is <hi>ſpecial bayl</hi> againſt death; It is ſuch <hi>wealth,</hi> as will be currant in the other World; <hi>lay up your trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in Heaven,</hi> where neither Thief nor Moth, neither Men nor Divels, can rob you of it. Take God in Chriſt for your Heaven, and you are happy in ſpight of the World, Death and Hell. You know the living comfort of your dying Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was, that though <hi>his fleſh and heart failed him, yet God was the ſtrength of his heart and his portion for ever.</hi> And it was a memorable ſpeech of <hi>His,</hi> when ſome Friends came to him and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the richneſs and magnificence of <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, newly trimmed and adorned for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception

            <p>The Child may walk in that dark entry with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear, if he have but his Father by the hand; <hi>Though I walk in the Valley of the ſhadow of Death, I will fear none ill, for thou art with me.</hi> Death indeed is <hi>ſtrong,</hi> it overcometh <hi>Principalities</hi> and <hi>Powers,</hi> but as ſtrong as it is, it cannot ſeparate God and the godly perſon. It may diſſolve the <hi>natural union</hi> betwixt ſoul and body, but not the <hi>myſtical union</hi> betwixt God and the ſoul; The Saints <hi>dye in the Lord, they ſleep in Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O Couzen, be married to Chriſt, and you are made for ever. Heaven is the Joynture, and Death one of the Servants or ſlaves of her that is the Spouſe of this Lord. <hi>Death is yours, ye are Chriſts,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.21.

            <p>The enſuing Diſcourſe was for the ſubſtantial part of it, delivered at the Funeral of your dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Relation on earth. You gave me the Text, and my indiſpoſition of body allowed me then but little time, which cauſed me now to make ſome enlargements and additions, but its the ſame

I preſent it to you, not doubting of its acceptance, for his ſake whoſe death was the occaſion of it.

            <p>In Teſtimony of my unfeigned love, I preſent you with this brief diſcourſe, which was <hi>conceived</hi> in your <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and through the importunity of ſeveral of you, <hi>brought forth</hi> to the <hi>Preſs.</hi> The occaſion of it (as is well known to you) was the Death of your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and my dear Relation, Maſter <hi>Caleb Swinnock,</hi> (who was interred <hi>May, 21. 1662</hi>) whoſe Father and Grand-father had three or four times enjoyed the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt honour, and exerciſed the higheſt Office in your Corporation. I am much of his mind, who ſaith, <hi>That Funeral Encomiaſticks of the dead, are often confections of poiſon to the living; for many whoſe lives ſpeak nothing for them, will draw the example into conſequence, and be thereby led into hope, that they may preſs an Hackny Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Sermon, to carry them to Heaven when they dye;</hi> and therefore am always ſparing my ſelf, though I condemn not the cuſtome in others, where they do it with prudence, and upon good cauſe. My Friends holy carriage in his ſickneſs (beſides his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſiveneſs for ought I ever heard in his health) commandeth me to hope that his ſoul is in Heaven. I had the happineſs ſome time to be brought up with him, in his Fathers Mr. <hi>Robert Swinnocks</hi> Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whoſe Houſe (I cannot but ſpeak it to the glory of God) had <hi>Holineſs to the Lord</hi> written upon it. His manner was to pray twice a day by himſelf, once or twice a day with his Wife, and twice a day with
<pb facs="tcp:100701:9"/> his Family, beſides ſinging Pſalms, Reading and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding Scriptures, which morning and evening were minded. The Sabbath he dedicated wholly to Gods ſervice, and did not onely himſelf, but took care that all within his Gate ſhould ſpend the day in ſecret, and private duties, and in attendance on publique Ordinances; of their proficiency by the laſt, he would take an account upon their return from the Aſſembly. His houſe indeed was as <hi>Tremellius</hi> ſaith of <hi>Cramners, Palaeſtra Pietatis, a Scool of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> I Write this not ſo much for the Honour of him (of whoſe induſtry for the good of the ſouls com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, I was a frequent eye witneſs, and whoſe memory is bleſſed) but chiefly for your good, that as ſome of you do already, ſo others alſo may be provoked to follow ſuch gracious patterns. I muſt tell you, that what low thoughts ſoever any of you now may have of holy perſons, and holy practices, yet when you come to look Death in the face, and enter into your unchangeable eſtates, a little of their grace and godlineſs will be of more worth in your eſteems then the whole World. Though the Saint be markt for a <hi>fool</hi> in the <hi>Worlds Calender</hi> at this day, and the proſperous Sinner counted the <hi>wiſeſt perſon;</hi> yet when the eyes of ſinners bodies are cloſed, the eyes of their ſouls will be opened; and then, O then, they will ſee and ſay according to that Apocryphal place which will be found Canonical for the matter of it, <hi>We Fools counted his life to be madneſs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Wiſdom 5. 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>and his end to be without honour; But now he is numbred among the Children of God, and his lot is among the Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Subject of this Tractate is partly, <hi>The true way to
<pb facs="tcp:100701:10"/> dye well;</hi> which I am ſure is of infinite concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to your immortal ſouls, and ſuch a Leſſon, that if it be not learned you are loſt for ever.<note place="margin">Laert.</note> The <hi>Cynick</hi> cared not what became of his body when dead, and the other <hi>Heathen</hi> could ſlight the loſs of a Grave,<note place="margin">Facilis jactura Sepulchri.</note> a little Earth; but without queſtion it concerns you nearly to take care what becomes of your ſouls, and you cannot ſo eaſily bear the loſs of God and Heaven.</p>
            <p>Men indeed are generally unwilling to hear of Death, and the Miniſter who would urge them to it, is as unwelcome as foul weather, which uſually comes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its ſent for; whatſoever hath a tendency to Death is killing; the <hi>telling</hi> them of it ſounds as mournfully in their ears as the <hi>tolling of a paſſing Bell;</hi> and the <hi>making their Wills</hi> as frightful to them, as the <hi>making their Graves.</hi> Hence, when they are riding poſt in the <hi>broad way</hi> of ſin and the World, and conſcience would check and <hi>rein</hi> them in with the <hi>curbs</hi> of <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Judgement,</hi> they preſently ſnap them in peices, and ſtifle its convictions; They dare not look into the book of Conſcience, to ſee how accounts ſtand between God and themſelves, but like <hi>Hauks</hi> are ever <hi>Hooded</hi> within doors,<note place="margin">Mori timeat qui ad ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam mortem de hac morte tranſibit.

            <p>The <hi>Egyptian</hi> ſlaves drank Wine freely, and wrapt their heads in Vails, that they might dye without ſight or ſorrow. I know many drown the thoughts of their future mourning in carnal pleaſure and preſent mirth, but ſuch mirth, like <hi>Nabals,</hi> will laſt no longer, then while they are <hi>drunk</hi> with <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>ſenſleſneſs;</hi> for they no ſooner come to themſelves, to underſtand the ſtate they are in, but <hi>their hearts dye within them.</hi> Beſides, hereby they put themſelves upon a neceſſity of periſhing;
<pb facs="tcp:100701:10"/> for, alas how will they do to dye, who conſider not before hand of their latter end.</p>

               <hi>Naturaliſts</hi> tell us of a <hi>Cockatrice, that if men ſee it firſt, that dyeth, if that ſeeth a man firſt, the man dyeth.</hi> Its moſt true of Death, if we ſee it <hi>firſt</hi> by an holy preparation for it, we <hi>kill</hi> it, it cannot <hi>hurt</hi> us; but if Death ſee and ſeiſe us <hi>firſt,</hi> it kills us eternally. O believe it ſirs; Its another manner of thing to dye well, then the ſleepy World dreams of. The luſtieſt of you all muſt expect that ere long Death will trip up your heels, and give you a <hi>fall.</hi> Ask your ſouls whither you are ready for it; <hi>Will it not prove your downfal?</hi> When Death <hi>throweth</hi> you, will it not be your eternal <hi>overthrow?</hi> Its poſſible ye think, of preparing for Death hereafter, but why not now? Do any of you ſay, <hi>To morrow I will repent?</hi> What if God ſay, <hi>Thou Fool this Night thy ſoul ſhall be required of thee?</hi> Where are you then? Its one of the greateſt ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems of the Devil, whereby he hath undermined mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of ſouls, by prevailing with them to delay till it was too late. O Conſider, Death like Thunder and Lightning blaſteth the green corn, and conſumeth the ſtrongeſt buildings, <hi>Job 21.23, 24. One dyeth in his full ſtrength, being wholly at eaſe and quiet. His breaſts are full of Milk, and his bones are moiſtened with Marrow.</hi> The Cock in the <hi>Arabick</hi> Fable, having overcome another Cock in a Battel, thought now that he had no Enemy,<note place="margin">Vide. Locmu.</note> and therefore got to the top of an Houſe, and began to crow and clap his Wings in token of Triumph. When behold on a ſudden, a <hi>Vulture</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and ſnatcheth away this braging Champion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour. If nature in any of you have maſtered one di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtemper, it gives you not leave to be ſecure, for an
<pb facs="tcp:100701:11"/> outward accident or inward diſeaſe will on a ſudden Maſter you.</p>
            <p>It is obſervable in the days of <hi>Solomon,</hi> when <hi>Iſrael</hi> enjoyed the greateſt peace, they made ſtrong preparation for War, <hi>1 Kings 4.25, 26. And</hi> Iſrael <hi>and</hi> Judah <hi>dwelt every man under his own Vine, and Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree.

This is the portion, which is as the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour ſaid of his Maſters treaſure in the <hi>Indies, without a bottom.</hi> Though the <hi>ſeven ſtreams</hi> of <hi>Nilus</hi> are known, yet the head of it was never found out. <hi>Much</hi> of the riches and beauty and perfections of the ever bleſſed God may be read in the book of the creatures; <hi>more</hi> may be ſeen in the glaſs of the Scriptures, but the longeſt line of humane or Angelical underſtanding, can never fathom his boundleſs, bottomleſs nature and being,
<pb facs="tcp:100701:13"/> yet there is ſo much to be known of him even in his life, as may draw out your hearts to chuſe and cloſe with him. The World is ready to wonder what the people of God ſee or enjoy in him, that they are ſo fearful of his fury, and ſo joyfully in his favour; as the ignorant wretch could ſee nothing in the Picture of <hi>Helena,</hi> why <hi>Nicoſtratus</hi> ſhould admire it ſo much, but as <hi>Nicoſtratus</hi> told him, <hi>O friend if thou hadſt my eyes, thou wouldſt wonder at it as much as I do;</hi> ſo had the World but the Saints eyes, could they ſee what a <hi>Crown of glory, What a Paradice of pleaſures, What a Mine of riches, What a loving, able, and faithful friend</hi> God is, could they but behold that <hi>beauty,</hi> and <hi>bounty, grace,</hi> and <hi>peace, love,</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> which are in the infinite God, they would admire him too; yea their eyes would affect their hearts,<note place="margin">Qui Venetias non vidit, non credit, &amp; quiae aliquandi ibi non vixit intelligit.</note> that they could not but love him, and delight in him, but Satan with his black hand (like Swallows dung) puts out mens eyes, that they not ſeeing ſo great a good, might not deſire him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Italians</hi> have a Proverb, <hi>He who hath not ſeen</hi> Venice <hi>doth not beleive; and he who hath not lived there ſome time, doth not underſtand what a City it is.</hi> This is moſt true of God; <hi>he who hath not with</hi> Moſes <hi>ſeen him that is inviſible, doth not beleive; and he who never had fellowſhip with the Father and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt his ſon, cannot underſtand what a vaſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient and infinite portion the eternal God is.</hi> O friends, did your eyes with <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ſee this Lord of Hoſts, or with <hi>Iſraels</hi> Magiſtrate beheld but his back parts; or had you with <hi>Paul</hi> ever been caught up into the third heavens, ye would quickly trample on all the honours and pleaſures, and treaſures of this lower World, as toys and trifles, and ſay with <hi>David, whom have we in heaven but thee, and

            <p>I have undertaken briefly in the enſuing diſcourſe to ſhew alſo the vaſt difference between the Chriſtians, and the Worldlings portion, by which you may underſtand, that if any one among you could enjoy the <hi>wealth</hi> of <hi>Craeſus,</hi> the <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> of <hi>Solomon,</hi> the <hi>beauty</hi> of <hi>Abſolom,</hi> the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> the <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures</hi> of <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> and to all, the <hi>long</hi> life of <hi>Methu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelah;</hi> yet in the midſt of all theſe, his ſoul would be as <hi>beggerly</hi> as the body of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and as <hi>reſtleſs</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied</hi> as the ſtormy tempeſtuous <hi>Ocean. No Water,</hi> ſay <hi>Naturaliſts, will quench the Dragons thirſt.</hi> No creature can fill the vaſt deſires of a capatious, immortal ſoul. As among all the <hi>Beaſts</hi> of the field there was not a <hi>meet Companion for man, Adam</hi> was <hi>ſolitary</hi> and alone, notwithſtanding their numerous ſociety; ſo amongſt all the creatures in the World, there is not a <hi>meet portion for the ſoul,</hi> its <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>beggerly</hi> without God, in the midſt of all its poſſeſſions; your heads may be ſolicitous, and your hearts induſtrious, to heap up creature-comforts, and when ye have got what the World can give, ye would be but as hungry men in a Room full of Stones or Chips. That which is <hi>unſutable</hi> to the ſouls nature, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>ſatisfying</hi> to the ſpirits deſires.</p>
            <p>There is a nouriſhment <hi>proper</hi> to every Animal. <hi>Spiders</hi> feed on <hi>Flies, Moles</hi> on <hi>Worms;</hi> the <hi>Horſe</hi> on <hi>Graſs,</hi> the <hi>Lyon</hi> on <hi>Fleſh;</hi> there is alſo food <hi>proper</hi> to mans <hi>ſoul, Spiritual Meat, and ſpiritual Drink; my fleſh is Meat indeed, my blood is Drink indeed</hi> (all other is <hi>bibi &amp; potus tantummodo umbra) this this is that, which when the ſoul comes once to feed on it, its filled, its ſatisfied.</hi>

While the ſoul faſteneth on any ſublunary thing, as its happineſs it deſireth more and better, but when it doth once chuſe the bleſſed God, it deſireth no more, no better, becauſe of thoſe infinite perfections which are in God.

               <p>For the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the Pſalm, it containeth the <hi>Godly mans Tryal</hi> in the former part of it, and his <hi>Triumph</hi> in the latter part of it. We have</p>

               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Pſalmiſts carriage</hi> after it.</p>

               <p>Firſt, The <hi>Cauſe</hi> of it, <hi>When I ſaw the proſperity of the wicked, ver.</hi> 3. His heart was pained, becauſe prophane men proſpered. That <hi>weeds</hi> which cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered the ground, ſhould be watered ſo plentifully, and grow ſo exceedingly, when <hi>good corn</hi> was ſo thin and lean: That the <hi>Lion</hi> and <hi>Raven,</hi> thoſe unclean creatures, ſhould be ſpared, when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent <hi>Lamb</hi> and <hi>Dove</hi> were ſacrificed: That the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100701:23"/> wicked ſhould flouriſh like the Bay-tree, enjoy a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Spring and Summer, be freſh and green all the year, though without fruit; when Saints like good Apple-trees had their Autumn and Winter; this touched the good man to the quick; his ſore eyes could not behold the glorious ſunſhine of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity without much pain.</p>
               <p>The Heathen have from the flouriſhing of ſuch unholy perſons flatly denied all providence. <hi>Dioge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> the Cynick, ſeeing <hi>Harpalus</hi> a vicious fellow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing in wealth, whilſt he wallowed in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſaid, <hi>That the Gods took no care how things were carried here below.</hi> The <hi>Athenians</hi> upon the defeat and death of their honeſt General <hi>Nicias</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> concluded, <hi>That the divine Powers were wholly regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of humane affairs.</hi> And not onely theſe blind <hi>Heathen</hi> who walked in the night of darkneſs, but even Saints themſelves, who were able to ſee afar off, and who pondered the paths of their feet, have ſtumbled at this ſtone, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.1, 2. <hi>Hab:</hi> 1.13.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>Cure</hi> of his diſtemper; his diſeaſe was <hi>bad eyes: An envious eye is an evil eye;</hi> Why <hi>is thine eye evil becauſe mine is good, Matth.</hi> 20.15. His remedy was this, His eyes were anointed with ſome Eye-ſalve out of the Sanctuary which helped them. He ſaw the end of wicked mens proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to be no leſs then endleſs miſery; that they did but like Malefactors, go up the ladder above others, to be turned off and executed; and this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied him.</p>
               <p>The Heathen as they aſcribe the ſubject of the diſeaſe to many <hi>cauſes</hi> (ſome <hi>Naturaliſts</hi> to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples

                  </note> I confeſs the Maſter of <hi>Moral Philoſophy</hi> (whom I moſt admire of all Heathen) ſeemeth to harp upon the ſame ſtring with the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, Thoſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whom God approveth and loveth he exerciſeth and afflicteth: Thoſe whom he ſeemeth to ſpare; he reſerveth for future ſufferings.</hi> But an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary capacity may perceive by the Treatiſe (though there be many excellent things in it) how far the Moraliſt came ſhort of Chriſtianity. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo without queſtion that his ſight was not ſo good as to look into the other world, and there to ſee the eternal pains of the evil, and pleaſures of the good, which viſion did allay the ſtorm in the Prophets ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. He tells us indeed that vicious perſons are not diſmiſt, only their puniſhment is delayed; but to him this life was the time, and this world the place of their execution.</p>
               <p>That which did aſſwage thoſe boiſtrous Waves, which threatned to ſwallow up the ſoul of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100701:24"/> was the different concluſion of the Saints and ſinners converſations. By faith he foreſaw that the whole life of a wicked man was but a <hi>Tragedy;</hi> though its beginning might be chearful, yet its ending would be mournful; though their power were great on Earth for a time, yet their portion ſhould be in the loweſt Hell to eternity, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil I went into the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary of God, then underſtood I their end. Surely thou didſt ſet them in ſlippery places: thou caſteſt them down into deſtruction. How are they brought into deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as in a Moment, they were utterly conſumed with terrors,</hi> v. 17, 18, 19. They are but exalted as the Shell Fiſh by the Eagle (according to the Naturaliſts) to be thrown down on ſome Rock and devoured. Their moſt glorious proſperity is but like a Rainbow, which ſheweth it ſelf for a little time in all its gaudy colours and then vaniſheth. The Turks conſidering the unhappy end of their <hi>Viſiers,</hi> uſe this Proverb, <hi>He that is in the greateſt Office, is but a ſtatue of Glaſs.</hi> Wicked men walk on Glaſs or Ice (thou haſt ſet them in ſlippery places) on a ſudden their feet ſlip, they fall and break their Necks; Oh the ſad reckoning which they muſt have after all their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meetings; Though their ſweet morſels go down pleaſantly here, yet they will riſe in their Stomacks hereafter.</p>
               <p>The holy Prophet ſaw alſo that Saints after their <hi>ſhort ſtorm,</hi> ſhould enjoy an <hi>everlaſting calm; Thou ſhalt guide me by thy counſel, and afterwards receive me to glory,</hi> v. 24. As the Pillar of fire by Night, and cloud by Day, thou wilt march before, and direct me through the Wilderneſs of this World, till I come to <hi>Canaan.</hi>

My fleſh and my heart faileth me, but God is the ſtrength of my heart. Fleſh</hi> is ſometime taken for corrupt nature, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.13.

               <p>They who take the words in a <hi>good ſenſe,</hi> do not make them look back ſo far as to the beginning of the Pſalm, but onely to the Neighbour verſe. The Prophet (ſay they) having paſſionately fixt his heart on God as the moſt amiable object in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, (v. 25.) was tranſported therewith ſo exceſſively, and carried out in holy ſallies, after
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100701:25"/> him ſo vehemently, that he was ready to ſink and ſwoon away; his ſpirits were ready to expire through the exuberancy of his love to, and longings after the bleſſed God. The weak cask of his body was ready to break, and not able to hold that ſtrong and ſpiritual wine; <hi>My fleſh and my heart faileth me. I am ſo raviſhed with delight in, and ſo enlarged in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after this infinitely beautiful object, that there is no more ſpirit in me; I am ſick, yea if God ſhould not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, the ſtrength of my heart, ſhould die for love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They who expound the words in a <hi>civil ſence,</hi> (as I may ſay) affirm the ſentence to refer to the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt ſufferings.</p>
               <p>He had a good rod inſtead of a good piece of bread for his breakfaſt every morning, and the table was covered with ſackcloth, and furniſhed with the ſame bitter herbs both at Dinner and Supper; <hi>For all the day long have I been plagued, and chaſtened every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, verſ.</hi> 14.<note place="margin">Nam quicquid adverſi accid t, aut carni acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit aut animo. <hi>Muſcul. in loc.</hi>

The greateſt part of men are but Children of larger dimenſions, and are indeed more <hi>fooliſh,</hi> becauſe they ought to be more <hi>wiſe;</hi> What is their main work but to make proviſion for the fleſh? to provide fuel enough for the <hi>fire</hi> of its <hi>covetouſneſs,</hi> and pleaſant Water enough for the <hi>Leviathan</hi> of its <hi>voluptuouſneſs,</hi> and air enough for the <hi>Camelion</hi> of <hi>Ambition,</hi> as if God had no other deſign in ſending them into the World, but that they might be <hi>Cooks</hi> to <hi>dreſs</hi> their <hi>bodies</hi> as well as poſſibly might be for the <hi>Wormes.</hi> All their care is, <hi>What ſhall we Eat? and what ſhall we drink? and wherewith ſhall we be cloathed? and how ſhall we do to live in theſe dear and hard times?</hi> as ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in Dung-hills, they live and feed on ſuch
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100701:32"/> filth, never once asking their ſouls in earneſt, <hi>What wilt thou do for the bread which came down from Heaven, and how wilt thou do to put on the Robes of Chriſts righteouſneſs, that thy nakedneſs may not appear to thy ſhame, and O what wilt thou do to be ſaved, to live eternally.</hi> Theſe things are not in all their thoughts. Like Flies they are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with the ſpirits of Wine, and nouriſhed with froth; Its enough they think, if when they come to dye, they bequeath their ſouls to God in their Wills, (though its a thouſand to one if thoſe wills be proved in Heaven, I can tell them of unanſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable caveats, which the Judges Son will put in againſt them) and therefore their whole lives muſt be devoted to the ſervice of their bodies, like dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men they ſmel of earth, and carry its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion in their very countenances; If a man that had two houſes in his poſſeſſion, one whereof was his own <hi>free-hold for ever,</hi> and the other his <hi>Land-Lords,</hi> which he agreed to leave at an hours warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſhould neglect his own houſe, let all things there run to rack and ruine, but night and day be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and adorning his <hi>Land-Lords Houſe,</hi> as if he could never be at coſt enough; or make it neat enough; would not every one condemn this man for a fool or a mad man?

O this is one of the dolefulleſt ſights which eyes can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the ſervant to ride on horſe-back, and the Prince to go on foot; the ſenſitive appetite to be the grave of Religion, and the Dungeon of Reaſon.<note place="margin">Greg: de la NuZ.

Again, is not the well-being of thy body, invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the welfare of thy ſoul? As really as the branches depend on the root for its flouriſhing, thy body dependeth on thy ſoul for its ſalvation, how mad art thou therefore to let the Veſſel ſink, and yet preſume to preſerve the Paſſenger that ſayleth in it. Once more, ſhall not the life of thy ſpirit run parallel with the life of God himſelf, and the line of eternity? and hath not God himſelf told thee, <hi>that thy fleſh will fail thee?</hi> doſt thou not find it now and then tottering, and as it were telling thee that it muſt drop down? and art not thou a fool in grain, a fool in the higheſt degree, to place all thy happineſs for ever, to ſet all thy ſtreſs &amp; weight for thine unchangeable eſtate on this rotten bough which will certainly break under thee, when thou mighteſt have ſure footing, and lay up a good
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100701:34"/> Foundation by an hearty regarding thine Heaven-born ſoul; O conſider it, and give conſcience leave to call thee fool once, that thou mayſt be wiſe for ever. <hi>Attilus</hi> King of <hi>Swethland</hi> made a Dog King of the <hi>Danes,</hi> in revenge of ſome injuries recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from them. What wrong hath thy ſoul done thee, that to be revenged on it, and to ſpight it to purpoſe, thou makeſt its ſlave its Soveraign, that part by which thou art kin to the beaſts, its Lord and King.</p>
               <p>The truth is, were not men drowned in ſenſuality (as he whom <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpeaketh of; that knew not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſtood or ſat, till his ſlave told him,) and their conſciences ſeared and made ſenſleſs by them (as young Gallants being arreſted for debt, make the Serjeants drunk, and thereby eſcape at preſent) it would be impoſſible for men to live thus after the fleſh. But as ſome cunning theives, if there be a Maſtiff belonging to the houſe which they intend to Rob, give it ſome morſels which will keep it from barking, that ſo they may ſteal the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants Wealth, and they not have the leaſt war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning either to hinder or recover it. So the Devil hath an art to make mens conſciences dumb, whilſt he robs them of their ineſtimable ſouls; poor, fooliſh creatures they are lazing on their beds of carnal ſecurity, and delighting themſelves in their dreams of lying vanities, and in the interim he rifleth their houſes and taketh away all that is of any value. Yet as faſt as conſcience is now aſleep, twill ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly awake, as the Jaylor at midnight, and then what fears and frights will poſſeſs them? Ah how clearly will they ſee their folly, in ſowing to the fleſh,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100701:34"/> and truſting to that which was never true to any! then they will roar out, <hi>If we had ſerved our ſpirits, as faithfully as we have ſerved our fleſh, they would not have failed us thus.</hi>

               <p>When thou dieſt thou throweſt thy laſt caſt for thine everlaſting eſtate, thou ſhalt never be allowed a ſecond throw. An Error in death, is like an Error in the firſt Concoction, which cannot be mended in the ſecond. <hi>Where thou lodgeſt that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100701:36"/> Night thou dyeſt, thou art hous'd for ever.</hi> That work which is of ſuch infinite weight, and can be done but once, had need to be done well. God hath given thee but one Arrow to hit the mark with, Shoot that at randome and he will never put ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into thy Quiver; God will allow no ſecond Edition to correct the Erratas of the firſt, therefore it concerns thee with all imaginable ſeriouſneſs to conſider what thou doeſt when thou dieſt.</p>
               <p>One would think, thou ſhouldſt take little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in any creature, whilſt thy eternal ſtate is thus in danger. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> wondered at the Roman Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, that he could ſleep <hi>quietly</hi> when he had a great <hi>burden of debt upon him.</hi> What reſt canſt thou have, what delight in any thing thou enjoyeſt, who oweſt ſuch vaſt ſums to the Infinite Juſtice of God, when he is reſolved to have full ſatisfaction either in this or the other world?

Look on thy own <hi>houſe of clay,</hi> death poſſibly looks out at thy windows, however it looks in at thy windows; thou weareſt it in thy face, thou beareſt it in thy bones, and doth it not behove thee to prepare for it?

Doſt thou know that thy ruddy countenance will wax pale, thy ſparkling eyes look gaſtly, thy warm blood cool in thy veins, thy marrow dry up in thy bones, thy skin ſhrivel, thy ſinews ſhrink, nay thy very heart ſtrings crack?</hi> And haſt thou provided never a cordial againſt this hour? Doſt thou not read in the writings of God himſelf, <hi>That no man hath power in the day of death, and there is no diſcharge in that war,</hi> Eccleſ. 8.8. <hi>No man hath power,</hi> either to reſiſt deaths force, or to procure termes of peace. The greateſt Emperor with the ſtrength of all his dominions cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Death.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100701:43"/> thou launcheſt into the Ocean, the boyſterous Waves, and tempeſtuous Winds will ſoon diſcover thy leaks and tell thee what is lacking.</p>
               <p>Its like enough thou haſt ſome armour with which thou hopeſt to defend thy ſelf againſt the ſtroaks of death, but know for a truth that Death will ſtab thee through all thy Paper Shields of profeſſion, priviledges, and performances, ſince thou art a ſtranger to Chriſt and the power of godlineſs.</p>
               <p>Thy life is like the <hi>letting down</hi> a Fiſhermans net; thy death as the <hi>drawing up</hi> of this Net, while the Net is down a man cannot tell certainly what he ſhall catch, for the Nets may break, &amp; the Fiſh may eſcape; whilſt thou liveſt its not ſo evident what thine aim is, or what thine end ſhall be, but at thy Death, when the Net ſhall be drawn up, then thou wilt ſee what draught thou haſt made. Though godly men at their Deaths may look up to the Lord of life, and ſay, <hi>At thy word we have let down our Nets and caught abundantly; we fiſhed for holineſs, and have caught happineſs, fiſhed for grace, and have caught glory, and honour, and immortality, and eternal life; yet when the Net</hi> of thy life cometh to be drawn up, thou mayſt ſay with <hi>Peter, Lord I have fiſhed all Night (all my life time) and have caught nothing; I fiſhed for honours, and pleaſures, and riches, and I have caught nothing but the Weeds of wrath and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I bleſſed my ſelf many a time, like the vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident Husbandman, in the goodly ſhew which my Corn made on the ground; but now the threſhing time is come, I find nothing but Straw and Chaff, vanity and vexation.</hi>

The Hedghog gets to a pile of Apples, and gathers as many as ſhe can up upon her prickles, but when ſhe comes to her reſting place, her Hole, ſhe throweth them all down, and carryeth not one in with her. Thus men walk in a vain ſhadow, and diſquiet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in vain, heaping up riches which die with them; <hi>naked they come into the World, and naked they go out of the World. Plutarch</hi> wiſely compareth great men to <hi>Counters,</hi> which one hour ſtand for <hi>thouſands,</hi> and the next hour for <hi>nothing.

               <p>In that ſtorm of death all thy glory and riches which thou haſt taken ſuch pains, and wrought ſo hard for, muſt be thrown overboard.

               <p>When thoſe carnal comforts are gone, thy ſpiritual comforts (if thou haſt any) will be known. When the hand which held thee up by the Chin, and kept thee above Water is taken away, thy own skil in ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming will be diſcovered. When the vertue of thoſe Cordials which ſupported thy ſpirits for a time is ſpent, twill appear whither Nature hath any ſtrength or no.</p>

                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:100701:44"/> Thoſe Adverſaries which before were hid, and lay lurking as it were under the Hedge, will then appear openly, and wound thee to the very heart.</p>
               <p>Thy <hi>ſins</hi> will then aſſault thee. When the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner appeareth before the Judge, then the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is produced, and the Witneſſes which were never before thought of ſhew themſelves.

The fire burns me, yet conſumes me not, gives heat to ſcorch me, but no light to refreſh me. Here is blackneſs of darkneſs, yet I can ſee the heart cutting frowns of an angry God, and can ſee my ſelf to be infinitely miſerable.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100701:48"/> number, my heart would have ſome hope; but alas, alas, as it is intollerable, ſo it is unchangeable; as long as God is God, I muſt fry in theſe flames, all my tears ſhall not quench the leaſt ſpark of this fire, though I muſt weep for ever; all this fire will not dry up the leaſt tear, though it will burn for ever. O that I had never been, O that I might never be. What muſt I ever live, and yet never live! muſt I ever dye, and yet never dye! Conſider this all ye that paſs by, is there any ſorrow like unto our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows wherewith the Lord afflicteth us in the day of his fierce wrath, for who can dwell in ſuch everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing burnings? and who can abide ſuch devouring flames? O that the Mountains would fall on us, and the Hills cover us, from the preſence of him that ſits upon the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb, becauſe the day of his wrath is come and who can ſtand!</hi> O what a dreadful Sunſet of life will it be, which brings ſuch a diſmal Night of eternal death!</p>
               <p>O Friend, think of this now, how wilt thou do to dye? If thou ſhouldſt leave this life, in the ſervice of thy luſts, thou art thus irrecoverably loſt. Thou art miſerable beyond all expreſſions, beyond all conceptions; If <hi>Job</hi> becauſe of ſome temporal calamity curſed the day wherein he was born, and the Meſſenger that brought tidings of his birth, and deſired to dye rather then to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it, whom wilt thou curſe, or rather, whom wilt thou not curſe, when under the ſenſe of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal miſery? ſurely thou wilt ſeek for death, but not find it, dig for it, but twill flee from thee.

It is the obſervation of the School-men, that what befel the Angels when they ſinned, that befals every wicked man at Death; the Angels upon the firſt act of ſin, were preſently by God himſelf ſtated in an irrecoverable condition of miſery; ſo wicked men, upon the laſt act of their lives, are fixt as to their eternal woful eſtates; <hi>It is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for all men once to dye, and after Death the judgement.</hi>

               <p>Pride, or an Ambitious deſire of ſelf ſufficiency, and ſelf ſubſiſtance, was the ſtone at which man at firſt ſtumbled, and fell into the bottomleſs pit of matchleſs miſery, it was the fatal Knife, which cut the throat of his glorious hopes and happineſs; the wiſe God therefore like a tender Father in mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, takes ſpecial care to lay theſe Weapons out of the Childrens way, by which they had wrought themſelves ſuch wo. Hence it is that he hath choſen thoſe two graces to make us happy, and carry us to <hi>himſelf,</hi> which ſpeak us to be moſt beggerly, and carry us moſt <hi>out of our ſelves. Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance. Faith</hi> teacheth us to deny our ſelves, as utterly weak, and <hi>Repentance</hi> cauſing us to <hi>abhor our ſelves,</hi> as altogether unworthy. Repentance diſcovereth our nakedneſs, and obnoxiouſneſs, thereby to ſhame and ſuffering; and Faith telleth that our own rags
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100701:52"/> come infinitely ſhort of hiding it, and that we muſt fetch our garments out of anothers Wardrobe. The whole Globe of Chriſtianity divideth it ſelf into theſe two Hemiſpheres. As the bodily life conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in natural heat, and radical moyſture, ſo the life of the ſoul in <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore Reader, if thou wouldſt dye well, undergo that great change with comfort; it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and indiſpenſably neceſſary that thou mind theſe two changes before hand; A <hi>change</hi> of thy <hi>ſtate</hi> or condition which is wrought by <hi>faith;</hi> and a change of thy <hi>nature</hi> or <hi>diſpoſition</hi> which is wrought by <hi>Repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Door of thy happineſs hangs on theſe two Hinges, the merit of Chriſt without thee, and its acceptation with God for the juſtification of thy perſon; and ſecondly, the Spirit of Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee, and its operation for the ſanctification of thy nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A change of State requiſite</note>Firſt, There muſt of neceſſity <hi>be a change of thy ſtate by faith in Chriſt,</hi> or thou canſt never put thy head into the other World with comfort. There is no ſuch Shroud, ſuch a Winding-ſheet for the departing ſoul to be wrapt in, as the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of a Saviour; <hi>Pauls</hi> care was that he might not be found naked, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.3. O tis ſad indeed for thy ſoul to be ſummoned to appear before the jealous God, and to have nothing to cover thy nakedneſs. <hi>Adam</hi> knowing that he was naked, fled from God. Guilt cannot but be ſhie of a Judge; ſore eyes will not endure the ſight of the Sun. God is a conſuming fire to all who have not Jeſus Chriſt for their Skreen. He ſeemeth to every perſon as
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100701:52"/> 
                  <hi>Joſeph</hi> to the <hi>Patriarchs; Thou ſhalt not ſee my face with joy, except thou bringeſt thy Brother with thee.</hi> Tis alone in the Garments of thine Elder Brother, that thou canſt have a ſound hope to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the bleſſing.

               </p>
               <p>By nature thou art under the <hi>Covenant of works,</hi> and ſo bound to earn happineſs by thy fingers ends, if ever thou wilt have it; in which failing (for no meer man ever ſaild to bliſs in that bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom) thou art liable to the curſe of the Law, a bondſlave to thy Jaylor <hi>Satan,</hi> and an heir of Hell. If ever therefore thou wouldſt arrive at Heavens bleſſed port, there is a neceſſity of imbarquing in another Veſſel, and that is the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> by which thou mayſt be freed from all the former croſſes and curſes, and filled with all the ſpecial comforts, and rich cordials of the Goſpel. Now it is faith in Chriſt by which thou comeſt to be ſhipt in this Covenant, and ſurely it concerns thee then to get this grace. Many, nay Millions, are drowned and caſt away, ſayling through the boyſterous billows of death, in the broken bottom of the firſt Covenant, when others in the ſecond, ride in Triumph with top and top gallant to their deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Haven.</p>
               <p>Reader, If thou art out of this Covenant, thou art like a man in the midſt of the Sea, without any Boat or bottom, though ſome in Veſſels at the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100701:53"/> ſame time are ſafe, yet he is ſure to ſink. It is related of one, that being at the point of Drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a River and looking up, and ſeeing a Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow in the Skie (the ſign of Gods Covenant, that he would never more drown the World) he made this concluſion; <hi>What if God ſave the whole World from a deluge of Waters, and ſuffer me to periſh in this River, what good will that Covenant do me?</hi> So ſay I to thee, though thouſands eſcape a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge of wrath through Gods promiſe to Chriſt, and in Chriſt to his purified ones, what good will it do thee if thou periſheſt?</p>
               <p>An intereſt in this Covenant was the living com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of dying <hi>David, He hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant, ordered in all things, and ſure: for this is all my ſalvation, and all my deſire, although he make not my Houſe to grow,</hi> 2 Sam. 23.5. Mark how the pious King draws all the Wine which made his heart glad (in one of his laſt hours) from this Pipe. Death is one of the ſowreſt things in the World, and ſuch things require much ſugar to make them ſweet. <hi>David</hi> found ſo much honey in the Covenant, that therewith he made Death it ſelf a pleaſant, a deſireable Diſh. If you obſerve the beginning of the Chapter, you will find that his end was near; <hi>Now theſe be the laſt words of David.</hi> But this, this was the quiet and eaſe of his heart, that Gods Covenant with him was <hi>everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and without end. As Death is famous for its <hi>terror</hi> (being King thereof) ſo alſo for his <hi>power,</hi> it brings down the mighty Princes and Potentates of the Earth;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.6.</note> 
                  <hi>Samſon</hi> was but a Child in Deaths hands, hence we read when Scripture would draw ſtrength in
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100701:53"/> its full proportion and length, As <hi>ſtrong as Death:</hi> but as ſtrong as Death is, <hi>David</hi> knew it could not break in ſunder the Covenant between God and him, nor diſſolve the union betwixt his Saviour and his ſoul. The firmneſs of this Covenant being ſure footing for faith to ſtand on, is that which puts life into a dying Chriſtian. As Death, though it parted the ſoul and body of Chriſt, parted neither of them from the divine nature (they were as a Sword drawn by a man, the Sword is in one hand ſeparated from the Sheath in the other hand, but neither of them ſeparated from the man) ſo though Death break the natural union between the beleivers ſoul and body, it cannot break the myſtical union between Jeſus Chriſt and the ſoul, therefore Saints are ſaid to <hi>ſleep in Jeſus,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.14. And truely by the vertue of this Cordial, this Covenant, they are ſo far from flying back at the ſight of their Foe Death, that they can look him in the face with courage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. See how they triumph over him, as if he were already under their feet, <hi>O Death where is thy ſting, O Grave where is thy Victory,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.57, 58. <hi>The ſting of Death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the Law, but thanks be to God which hath given us the victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Hark, they ſpeak as <hi>Challengers,</hi> daring their diſarmed enemy to meet them in the field; and they ſpeak as <hi>Conquerors</hi> being aſſured through the Captain of their ſalvation of the victory before they fight. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> faith,<note place="margin">Epiph. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap <hi>33.</hi>
                  </note> that <hi>Adam</hi> was buried in <hi>Calvary,</hi> where <hi>Chriſt</hi> was crucified. Sure it is, that Chriſt at <hi>Calvary</hi> did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what which made the Chriſtians bed ſoft and eaſie, that whereas it would have been a bed of Thorns,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100701:54"/> he turned it into a bed of down, and thereby the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiver comes to lye on it ſo contentedly, and to ſleep ſo ſweetly and comfortably.</p>
               <p>By this time Reader, I hope thou underſtandeſt the neceſſity and benefit of this relative change. With this Covenant thou art armed Cap a pe with armour of proof (with the righteouſneſs of Chriſt) which is <hi>law proof, death proof, and judgement proof,</hi> and leaveſt Death wholly diſarmed and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. Without this thou haſt no Weapons and findeſt Death a man of War. In the forequoted place, thou ſeeſt that ſin is the ſting of Death, and the ſtrength of ſin is the Law. The Law binds the ſoul over for diſobedience to its precept, to its ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lediction and puniſhment, paſſeth a ſentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation already upon the creature, and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth its execution in that bondage and fear, as flaſhes of the unquenchable fire, which ſeize on men in this life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6. <hi>John</hi> 3.18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. And as ſin hath its ſtrength from the law (the law making it ſo powerful to curſe and condemn) ſo Death hath its ſtrength and ſting, its venome and vertue, to kill and damn, to deſtroy ſoul and body, for ever from ſin. Sin makes Death ſo deadly, that its the poyſon in the cup which makes it ſo mortal and loathſom a draught. Thy work and wiſdom therefore is (as the <hi>Philiſtinos</hi> when they heard that the great ſtrength of <hi>Samſon</hi> (the deſtroyer of their Country) lay in his hair, were reſtleſs till they had cut it off, and became weak ſo) now thou heareſt wherein the ſtrength of Death (the great deſtroyer and damner of ſouls) conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, to be unquiet night and day, to follow God up and down with ſighs and ſobs, ſtrong cries, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100701:54"/> deep groans for pardon of ſin, and to give thy ſelf no reſt till thou attaineſt an intereſt in this Covenant through Jeſus Chriſt. Pious <hi>Job,</hi> though not in thy caſe, was for this cauſe exceeding importunate for a ſenſe of this pardon. <hi>And why doſt thou not pardon mine iniquity, and take away my traſgreſſions? for now ſhall I ſleep in the duſt, and thou ſhalt ſeek me in the morning, and I ſhall not be,</hi> Job 7. <hi>ult.</hi> He cryeth out as one fallen into a deep dirty ditch, or one whoſe houſe is fired. <hi>Water, Water for the Lords ſake,</hi> to cleaſe this defiled ſoul, and to quench this ſcorched conſcience, Lord; <hi>Why doth the meſſenger (who uſeth to come poſt to me a poor condemned Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner with a pardon) lingring ſo long. Alas I wiſh he may not come too late.</hi> But what is the reaſon of this importunity for expedition? Why, <hi>Job</hi> in his own thoughts was going to appear before his Judge, and he durſt not venture without a pardon in his hand, <hi>for now ſhall I ſleep in the duſt.</hi> The child did not dare to go to bed at night till he had asked his Father Bleſſing, and begd and obtained forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his diſobedience in the day.</p>
               <p>Nothing in the whole creation can pacifie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, awakened with the guilt of ſin, and fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the fear of death, but a pardon in the blood of this Covenant, for want of this it was that the Heathen were either deſperate or doubtfull in their deaths; and their Orator ingeniouſly confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that notwithſtanding all the Medicines they could gather out of their own Gardens, the Diſeaſe was ſtill too ſtrong for the Remedy. But a plaiſter ſpread with the blood of Chriſt, and applied by faith to the ſore, is a ſoveraign and certain cure. Faith
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:100701:55"/> in Chriſt is ſuch a Shield, that under its protection, a Chriſtian may ſtand in the evil day of Death, keep his ground and ſecure himſelf from all the ſhot which the Law, Satan, or conſcience can make againſt him, <hi>I am the reſurrection and the life, He that liveth and beleiveth in me ſhall live though he dye,</hi> Joh. 11.</p>

I hope there is ſuch an Arrow of love darted into thy heart from the gracious eyes and looks of this Lord of glory, that thou art wounded thereby, and beginneſt of a ſudden to be taken with him, and to wiſh, <hi>O that I might have the honour and happineſs to become the Bride of ſo lovely a Bridegroom, that this King of Saints would take me a poor ſinner into his bed and boſome;</hi> Thou ſayſt as <hi>Abigal</hi> when <hi>David</hi> ſent to take her to Wife, <hi>Behold, let thine hand-maid be a ſervant to waſh the feet of the Servants of my Lord;</hi> I am unworthy to be his Spouſe. If it be thus with thee, I ſee that thy affections are already entangled,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100701:58"/> and for thy comfort, know that he is not of the number of them, who when they have gained others good will, then caſt them off. Onely it will be needful that thou underſtand what he requires of thee, to avoid all future jars and differences; plain dealing is never more neceſſary then in Marriage; thoſe that by dawbing have hudled up Matches in haſt, have found cauſe enough to repent at leiſure.</p>
               <p>I ſhall propound two Arguments for thy encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement;<note place="margin">Motives to the beſt match.</note> and then demand thy agreement to two Articles, upon which and no other this Match can be concluded.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The neceſſity of it.</note> Conſider the <hi>neceſſity of thy Acceptance of Chriſt for thy Husband.</hi> It is impoſſible to obtain Heaven for thy Joynture, but by Marrying with him who is the Heir. It may be, like him in <hi>Ruth (Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2, 3, 4. whom the Spirit of God thought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be named) thou art ready for the band, the portion, but unwilling to marry the perſon; thou art forward to be pardoned, adopted and ſaved, but backward to take Jeſus Chriſt for thy Husband, leaſt thou ſhouldſt loſe thy ſinful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and thereby <hi>mar</hi> (in thy Opinion) <hi>a better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.</hi> But know of a certain (as <hi>Boaz</hi> told him) <hi>What day thou buyeſt the field, thou muſt Marry the owner of it. What day thou gaineſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable priviledges of the Goſpel, thou muſt Match with Chriſt the Purchaſer and owner of them.</hi> There is no gaining the precious fruit, but by getting the Tree that bears it. Indeed thy Marriage with
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100701:59"/> him is ſo fruitful a bleſſing that thou needeſt no more. Forgiveneſs of ſins, the love of God, peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, joy in the Holy Ghoſt, eternal life, every good thing, all good things are in the Womb of it; thou canſt not imagine what a numerous poſterity of <hi>Barnabaſſes,</hi> of <hi>ſons of conſolation,</hi> would be the effect and iſſue of ſuch a Wedding; but it is ſo <hi>need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> a bleſſing that without it thou art compleatly and eternally woful; beware, O beware how thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeſt ſo good an offer, for thou art in the ſame condition with the Woman taken captive by the Jews, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 21.) either to marry or dye, either to match with Chriſt, or be damned for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Gods clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in its offer.</note>Secondly, Conſider <hi>Gods clemency and condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> in tendering thee ſo great a fortune: Kings on Earth will not ſtoop ſo low (unleſs neceſſity force it) as to match their onely Sons with their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, though he and they are of the ſame make and mould, if they do, it is with the higheſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, with ſuch among them as ſparkle moſt with the Diamonds of birth, breeding, beauty, riches and glory; but (hear O Heavens, and be aſtoniſhed O Earth) wonder O Reader, at this low ſtoop of the infinite God; He is willing, nay earneſt that his onely Son and Heir, the King of Kings ſhould marry with his creature (between whom and him, there is an infinite diſtance and diſproportion) nay not with the Nobleſt Houſe among thoſe creatures, not with Angels thoſe heavenly Courtiers (He is their Head, not their Husband) though by matching with them he had matched ſomewhat more like himſelf, but with
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100701:59"/> ſinful polluted Duſt and Aſhes. That our ſpiritual ſouls ſhould be joyned to our earthly bodies is much, yet here is ſome proportion, (both are limited, created beings) but that God ſhould marry with Man is infinitely more. Its ſaid of the King of <hi>Babylon, that he lifted up the head of</hi> Jehojachin <hi>out of Priſon, and ſpake kindly to him, and changed his Priſon Garments, and ſet his Throne above the Throne of the Kings that were with him,</hi> (2 Kings <hi>ult. cap.</hi> 27, 28, 29.) Man was a poor Priſoner, bound and fettered with his own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, kept up cloſe by the Devil his Jaylor; and condemned to ſuffer the pains of eternal death, but loe the Philanthropy and kindneſs of God, he ſendeth his onely Son to open the Priſon Doors, (having firſt ſatisfied the Law, for the breach of which they were caſt in, and removed its curſe which was as a Pad-Lock on the Priſon Gate to to keep it faſt,) ſet the poor captives at liberty, change their naſty Priſon weeds, and to exalt their nature above the nature of glorious Angels, by marrying it to himſelf. Canſt thou find in thy heart Friend to abuſe ſuch Matchleſs <hi>Grace and Favour?</hi> Is not that begger mad that ſhould refuſe the real offers of a Match from a Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Emperour? Shall Majeſty thus ſtoop to Miſery in vain? I muſt tell thee, its infinite abaſement in God, thus to make ſuit to thee, but its the higheſt preferment thou art capable of (nay, ſuch as it had been blaſphemy to have deſired it, had not God offered it) to cloſe with him.</p>
               <p>I come now to the Articles of this Marriage,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100701:60"/> which truely are no more then thou requireſt of thy own wife (if thou haſt any) and therefore thou canſt not but think them reaſonable. I ſhall propound them to thee in theſe two Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Art thou heartily willing to take Jeſus Chriſt for thy Saviour and Soveraign? Canſt thou love him with the hotteſt ſuperlative love as thy Husband? (Its one thing to love a man as a Friend, and another thing to love him as thy Husband) canſt thou give him the keys of thy heart, and keep thy affections as a fountain, ſealed up from others, and opened onely for him, and in ſubordination to him? Wilt thou honour him with the higheſt honour as thy Lord; ſubmitting to his ſpirit as thy guide, and to his laws as thy rule? Is thy ſoul ſo raviſhed with the beauty of his perſon, the excellency of his promiſes, and the equity of his precepts, that thou dareſt promiſe through his ſtrength to be a loving, faithful and obedient wife? Have the hot beams of that love which have been dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted forth from this Sun of Righteouſneſs (as the rays of the Sun united in a glaſs) turned thee into a flame, that thy heart is now aſcending and mounting to Heaven, where thy Beloved is, and thou canſt no more live without him, then thy body without thy ſoul? Art thou willing to be ſanctified by his ſpirit, that thou mighteſt be prepared for his boſome and embraces, and to be ſaved alone by his merits, as the onely procuring cauſe of all thy hopes and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Wilt thou take him for better and for worſe, for richer and for poorer, with his cup of affliction, as well as his cup of conſolation; with his ſhameful
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100701:60"/> Croſs, as well as his glorious Crown; choſing rather to ſuffer with him, then to reign without him; to dye for him, then to live from him? Such as marry thou knoweſt muſt expect trouble in the fleſh. Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity (like the Wind</hi> Caecias) <hi>doth ever draw clouds and afflictions after it, but thy future glory and pleaſure will abundantly recompence, thee for thy preſent pain and ignominy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Wilt thou preſently give a bill of Divorce to all other lovers, and keep the bed of thy heart wholly for him? Shall the evil of ſin never more have a good look from thee, but (as</hi> Ammon <hi>ſerved</hi> Tamar) <hi>ſhall the hatred wherewith thou hateſt thoſe filthy ſtrumpets (with whom thou haſt had curſed dalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, and committed ſpiritual fornication) be greater then the love wherewith thou haſt loved them? Canſt thou pack away the bond-woman, and her ſon, and theſe things not at all be greivous in thy ſight, that thy whole joy and delight may be in, and all that thou art worth preſerved for the true</hi> Iſaac? <hi>Shall this Sun reign alone in the Heavens of thy heart without any Competitour? As when a Dictatour was created at</hi> Rome, <hi>there was a</hi> ſuperſedeas <hi>to all other authority; ſo if Chriſt be exalted in thy ſoul, there muſt be a ceſſation of all other rule and power. Chriſt will not be a King meerly in diriſion as the Jews made him; nor as the ſtump of Wood was to the Frogs in the Fable, whom every luſt may ſecurely dance about and provoke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the terms upon which this match (ſo honourable and profitable) is offered to thee, give up an hearty <hi>Yea</hi> to theſe two equitable Articles,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100701:61"/> and thou art made for ever. Refuſe it, and thou art miſerable above all apprehenſions, and beyond Millions of ages even to all eternity. What ſayſt thou to it? Shall I put the ſame Queſtion to thee, which they put to <hi>Rebekah. Wilt thou go with this Man?</hi> In thy denyal there is no leſs then eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Death; Methinks the thoughts of that fire and Brimſtone ſhould force thee to flye to this <hi>Zoar;</hi> In thy unfeigned hearty acceptance, there is no leſs then Heaven and eternal life; What wouldſt thou not do to continue natural life? What then ſhouldſt thou not do or ſuffer for eternal life? It may be thou deſireſt time to conſider of it; as <hi>Rebekahs</hi> Mother, thou art willing to the match, but wouldſt not have it yet concluded. <hi>Auſtin</hi> bewails it in himſelf, that when God was drawing him to Chriſt, his carnal pleaſures repreſented themſelves before his eyes; Saying, <hi>What wilt thou leave us for ever, and ſhall we be no more with thee for ever?</hi> And then he threw himſelf down, and weeping cryed out. <hi>O Lord how long, how long ſhall I ſay to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, why not to day Lord, why not to day? Why ſhould there not be an end of my ſinful life this hour?</hi> But beleive it, delays are dangerous, eſpecially in works of ſuch weight.</p>
               <p>If thou anſwereſt (as <hi>Rebekah</hi> did) <hi>I will go.</hi> Chear up poor ſoul, what ever thy courſe or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage hath been (thy Husband is able and willing to pay all thy ſcores, were they a million for a mite) and come forth, behold thy beloved in his imbroyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and glory, ſee how his Arms are ſtretcht out to embrace thee, his Lips are ready to kiſs thee, O what a look of love he giveth thee; ſure I am, thou
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100701:61"/> art more in his heart then in thine own, little doſt thou think what Rings and Robes, what dainties and delicates, what grace and mercy, and peace he provided on purpoſe againſt the return of thee a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring prodigal. Thou needſt now no longer run a ſcore with the World for any of its courſe, carnal fare, thy beloved will entertain thee at his own table with curious and coſtly feaſts; thou ſhalt have bread to eat which the world knows not of. If dangers and evils purſue thee, thou haſt thy City of refuge at hand, wherein thou mayſt be ſecure from the fear and fury of men and Devils.</p>
               <p>Twill be life to thee now to think of Death; thou mayſt lift up thy head with joy, when that day of thy redemption draweth nigh. Death will give thee a writ of eaſe both from ſin and ſorrow; then thy Indentures will expire, and thy ſoul be at liberty. Thou haſt now taken in thy full lading for Heaven, and mayſt therefore call (like a Merchant that hath all his goods on ſhipboard) to the Maſter of the Veſſel, to hoiſe up ſail and be gone towards thy everlaſting harbour. O how may thy heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive (with old <hi>Jacobs</hi>) to ſee thoſe wagons which are ſent to fetch thee to thy dear Jeſus, for thou knoweſt that he is Lord of the Countrey, and able to make thee welcome when thou comeſt thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>Now thou art preſent in the body, and ſo abſent from the Lord,</hi> but then thou ſhalt ever ever be with the Lord; but if thou refuſeſt ſo great, and ſo good an offer, chuſing ſlavery to the fleſh before this Chriſtian liberty, and reſolving (as many wicked ones do) rather to be free for many Harlots then to take one Wife; rather to love and ſerve divers
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100701:62"/> luſts and pleaſures, then to be wedded to Jeſus Chriſt; go on, take thy courſe, but be confident that thy fleſhly life (like the head of <hi>Polypus</hi>) though pleaſant at preſent, will afterwards cauſe trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſleep and frightful Dreams. If thou inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt to lanch into the Ocean of eternity without this Pilot (the bleſſed Saviour, who alone can ſteer the Veſſel of thy ſoul, amidſt thoſe dangerous ſhelves and ſands aright) and the ballaſt of grace, not regarding what paſſage thou haſt, nor at what Port thou arriveſt in the other World, whether Heaven or Hell; prepare thy ſelf to take up thine eternal lodging amongſt frightful Devils, and to bear thy part in the endleſs yellowings, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of the Damned; and know withal to thy terror, that this very tender of grace will one day like <hi>Joabs</hi> Sword to <hi>Abner,</hi> ſtab thee under the fift rib, cut thee to the very heart, and like a mountain of Lead ſinck thee deep into that Ocean of wrath, when thou ſhalt have time enough to befool thy ſelf for refuſing ſo good an offer; and where thou ſhalt be tormented day and night for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I have this day ſet before thee life and death, bleſſing and curſing, therefore chuſe life that both thou and thy ſeed may live. That thou mayſt love the Lord thy God, and that thou mayſt obey his voice, and that thou mayſt cleave unto him; for he is thy life and the length of thy days,</hi> Deut. 30.19, 20.</p>

                  <head>The firſt Means.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take heed of blotting thy Evidences for Heaven: Darkneſs</hi> we know is very dreadful,<note place="margin">1 Blot not thy evidences for Heaven.</note> when men by great or willful, ſins have ſo blurred the deeds which ſpeak their right to Heaven, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not read them; no wonder if being thus in the dark they are affraid to leave the earth.</p>
                  <p>It is reported of good <hi>Agathon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Doroth Doct. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> that when death approached he was much troubled, whereupon his friends ſaid unto him, <hi>What doſt thou fear?</hi> He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>I have endeavoured to keep the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God; but I am a man, and how do I know whether my works pleaſe God or no? for other is the judgement of God, and other is the judgement of men.</hi> He muſt needs be troubled to be removed from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent pleaſures, who knoweth not that he ſhall go to a better place. Twenty pounds a year certain is counted better then (and a man will be unwill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to part with it for) forty pounds a year that is doubtful. It is aſſurance onely of a better life which will carry the ſoul with comfort through the bitter pangs of death. Hence it was that <hi>Job</hi> called ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and cried ſo earneſtly to be laid to bed; <hi>O that I might have my requeſt, that God would grant me the thing that I long for, even that it would pleaſe God to deſtroy me; that he would let looſe his hand and cut me off, then ſhould I yet have comfort. Let
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100701:64"/> him not ſpare, for I have not concealed the words of the holy one,</hi> Job 6.8, 9, 10. <hi>Job</hi> had lived with a good conſcience, and therefore feared not to dye with great comfort. His fidelity to God, encouraged him to expect mercy from God; He had not concealed nor ſhut up Gods faithfulneſs from men, and therefore knew that God would not conceal his loving kindneſs from him. But <hi>David</hi> on the other hand, when night (in his own thoughts) drew near, was as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate to fit up longer; God ſeemed to call him to bed, but he begs hard, <hi>O ſpare me that I may recover ſtrength, before I go hence, and be no more,</hi> Pſa. 39. <hi>ult.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now mark the reaſon of this petition. <hi>David</hi> as tis generally conceived, was now perſecuted by <hi>Abſolom;</hi> the unnatural Son forced his Father to flie; He in his ſuffering reads his own ſin, and Gods indignation, and ſo dreads an appearance in the other World in ſuch a condition. He, who when things were clear betwixt God and his ſoul, could walk in the valley of the ſhadow of Death and fear none ill, could even give Death a chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge; now when things are cloudy and dubious runs back like a Coward; He had loſt the ſenſe of Gods favour, and therefore could not think of venturing into his preſence without much fear. The train of his corruptions threatned to wait on him to the higheſt Court, and he durſt not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the Lord with ſuch company. He had been declining in his grace under a ſad diſtemper,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100701:64"/> and as a weak conſumptionate man, he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to travail ſo great a journey, as the way whence he ſhould never return. The Tenant who wants his rent, loves not to hear of the Quarter day.</p>
                  <p>Friend, If thou wouldſt leave the World chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, live in the World conſcienciouſly, take heed of thoſe fiends which will fright thee in the night of Death; chuſe ſuffering before ſin; and puniſh thy body to keep thy ſoul pure. The <hi>Ermin</hi> ſome ſay will die before ſhe will go into the Dirt to defile her beautiful skin; and the Mouſe of <hi>Armenia</hi> will rather be taken and ſlain, then preſerve and pollute her ſelf in a filthy Hole. As the white is always in the Archers eye, ſo let thy Death be in thine, that it may quicken thee to diligence and exactneſs in thy life.</p>
                  <p>Logicians who regard not the premiſes, infer wilde concluſions; ſo if thou art careleſs of thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, expect but an uncomfortable diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As when God looked on all his works, and ſaw that they were good, then followed his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of reſt; ſo when thou canſt reflect upon the ſeveral paſſages of thy life, and ſee that through Chriſt they are good, and thou haſt not been guilty of enormities, though of infirmities; after this thou wilt joyfully by Death, enter into thy everlaſting Sabbath. Thy evidence will be clear, if thy conſcience be kept clean; but the truth is, many, even amongſt Chriſtians, wound their ſouls
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100701:65"/> by venturing on ſin, and thence flinch and ſtart back, when they come to be ſearcht; beſides they neglect caſting up their accounts ſo long, that they know not whether they are worth any thing or nothing, and ſo may well be unwilling to have their eſtates ranſackt into.</p>
                  <p>If thou ſhouldſt fall; (I would not ſad any Saint) take heed of lying there, but be as ſpeedy as is poſſible in calling to Chriſt to raiſe thee up. If thy conſcience be raw with the guilt of any ſin, a light affliction (much more Death) will make thee kick and fling and unwilling to bear it. But when thy fleſh is ſound (thy ſpirit healed by the blood of Chriſt) Death it ſelf will be but a light burden on thy back. How merrily mayſt thou (though thou haſt not a penny in thine own purſe) go the way of all the Earth, travel into the other World, when thou art ſure of Chriſt in thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, who will bear thy charges all the way.</p>

The more thy affections are ſet on Chriſt, thy true Husband, the more the World is taken out of thee; and ſo the more eaſily wilt thou be taken out of the World.

Doſt thou dread this King of Terrors, Death, give not way to this fear, but bring death up to thy ſpirit, handle it, feel it, there is no ſuch hurt in it as thou imagineſt, nothing which ſhould terrifie thee, hereby at laſt thou mayſt come to play upon the hole of this Aſp.</p>
                  <p>One ground I ſuppoſe why <hi>Job</hi> made no more of dying, was, becauſe he was ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Death.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:100701:66"/> familiar with Death, as if it had been his <hi>Father;</hi> and made no more of dying, then of falling into the Armes and embraces of his <hi>Mother</hi> or <hi>Siſter Moſes</hi> at firſt ſtarted back at the ſight of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, but when he had handled it a little, twas turned into a rod and nothing frightful to him.</p>
                  <p>There is a ſtory of an Aſs, called <hi>Cumanus Aſs,</hi> which jetting up and down in a Lyons skin, did for a time much terrifie his Maſter, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards being deſcried, did much benefit him. Thou art fearful poſſibly Reader, of this beaſt, ſuppoſing it to be a roaring Lyon, but come up to it, and thou wilt find it but an Aſs in the skin of a Lyon, and ſuch a one as will be no way hurtful, but many ways helpful to thee. What is this Bugbear Death which thus frights thee? Is it not the Paranymphus, which preſenteth thy faithful ſoul to thy beloved Husband? Is it not a leaving the World and a going to thy Father? Is it leſs then a kiſs of Gods lips? The indulgent parent will take the babe into her Arms, and with many kiſſes lay it in her lap, when its falling aſleep.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe tell us, <hi>Moſes</hi> dyed with a kiſs of the Lords mouth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.5.

                  </note> Mans Spirit often decayes with his fleſh: The Spirits and blood are let out together. His Heart fell with his fleſh; but what was the ſtrong cordial which kept him from ſwooning at ſuch a ſeaſon? Truly this, But God is the ſtrength of my heart, and my porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for ever. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> affirmeth of the <hi>Tortoys</hi> that it liveth when its heart is taken away. The holy man here liveth when his heart dyeth. As the Sap in winter retreateth to the root, and there is preſerved, ſo the Saint in croſſes, in death retireth to God, the Fountain of his life, and ſo is comforted. <hi>David</hi> when his Wives were captivated, his wealth plundred, and his very life threatned (for the Souldiers talked
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100701:68"/> of <hi>Stoning him</hi>) was doubtleſs in a very dreadfull eſtate; one would have thought ſuch an heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, muſt needs break his back; but behold, <hi>the joy of the Lord was his ſtrength; But David encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his heart in the Lord his God.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6. When the <hi>Table</hi> of earthly comforts (which for a long time at beſt, had been but <hi>indifferently ſpread</hi> for him) was quite empty, he fetcheth ſweet-meats out of his <hi>Heavenly Cloſet. But David encouraged his heart in the Lord his God. Methodius</hi> reporteth of the Plant <hi>Pyragnus</hi> that it flouriſheth in the flames of <hi>Olympus.</hi> Chriſtians (as the Salamander) may live in the greateſt fire of affliction, at this day; And (as the three Children) may ſing when the whole world ſhall be in a flame at the laſt day. They are by the Spirit of God compared to <hi>Palm-trees (Pſalm.</hi> 92.12.) which though many <hi>weights</hi> are hanging on the top, and much drought be at the bottom, are neither (ſay ſome Naturaliſts) born down nor dried up. This <hi>nightingale</hi> may warble out her pleaſant notes with the <hi>ſharpeſt thorne</hi> at her breaſt.</p>
               <p>The onely reaſon which I ſhall give of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,<note place="margin">Reaſon of the Doctrine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is his happineſs.</note> is this; <hi>Becauſe a Godly man placeth his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in God.</hi> Its natural to the creature in the mid'ſt of its ſufferings to draw its comfort and ſolace from that pipe, (whether ſuppoſed or real) happineſs. All things have a propenſity towards that in which they place their felicity. If a ſtone were lay'd in the Concave of the Moon, though air and fire and water are between, yet it would break through all, and be reſtleſs till it come to the earth its centre. Aſutable and unchangeable reſt, is the onely ſatisfaction of the rational creature. All the toſſings and agitations of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:100701:68"/> the ſoul are but ſo many wings to carry him hither and thither, that he may find out a place where to reſt. Let this Eagle once find out, and faſten on the true carcaſſe, he is contented; as the needle pointing to the North, though before in motion, yet now he is quiet. Therefore the Philoſopher though in one place he tells us that delight conſiſteth in motion, yet in another place tells us <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that it conſiſteth rather in reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Happineſe is nothing but the Sabbath of our thoughts and the ſatisfaction of our hearts in the fruition,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eth. lib <hi>7.</hi> cap. ult.</note> 
                  <hi>of the chiefeſt good.</hi> According to the excellency of the object which we embrace in our hearts, ſuch is the degree of our happineſs; the Saints choice is right, God alone being the ſouls center and reſt. <hi>Omnes literae in Jehovah ſunt literae qui eſcentes,</hi> ſay the <hi>Rabbies.</hi> Let a ſinner have but that which he count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his treaſure, though he be under many troubles he is contented.

               <p>No man thinks himſelf miſerable, till he hath loſt his happineſs. A Godlyman is bleſſed when afflictied and buffetted, becauſe God is the proper Orb in which he doth fix, and he hath his God ſtill: <hi>Job.</hi> 5.17. When a few leaves blow off, his comfort is, he hath

               <p>The Schoolmen tell us the reaſon why <hi>Adam</hi> in his eſtate of innocency felt no cold, though he
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100701:70"/> were naked, was becauſe of his Communion with God. God is the Saints <hi>ſhield</hi> to protect their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies from all blows, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.1. He is therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in Scripture to ſuch things and perſons as ſhelter men in ſtorms, defend them in dangers.

                  <note place="margin">Pſalm. 121.4.</note> he is ſo far from ſleeping that he never <hi>ſlumbereth.</hi> Some Naturaliſts tell us that Lions are <hi>inſomnes;</hi> poſſibly becauſe their eye-lids are too narrow for their eyes, and ſo they ſleep with their eyes partly open; but its moſt true of the <hi>Lion of the tribe of Judah.</hi> As <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> told his Soldiers, He wakes that they might ſleep in ſafety.

But inſtead of all, he is called the <hi>Lord of Hoſts</hi> or <hi>General</hi> of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, becauſe a faithfull Commander goeth firſt into the field, and cometh laſt out of the field. God look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth danger in the face before his people, and ſeeth

               <p>Travellers tell us that they who are at the top of the Alps, can ſee great ſhowres of rain fall under them, but not one drop of it falls on them, They who have God for their portion are in an high Tower. and thereby ſafe from all troubles and ſhowres; <hi>a drift-rain</hi> of evil will beat in at the creatures win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, be they never ſo well <hi>pointed;</hi> All the garments this world can make up, cannot keep them that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell in ſuch weather from being wet to the ſkin: No creature is able to bear the weight of its fellow-creature, but as reeds break under and as thorns run into the ſides that lean on them. The bow drawn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its compaſs breaks inſunder, and the ſtring wound above its ſtrength ſnaps in pieces; ſuch are outward helps to all that truſt to them in hardſhips.</p>
               <p>But Chriſtians being anchor'd on this rock of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, are ſecure in the greateſt ſtorm. They are like <hi>Sion which cannot be moved.</hi> The Church, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Motto of <hi>Venice,</hi> Immota manet. <hi>In time of trouble he hides them in his pavillion, and in the ſecret of his tabernacle he ſets them upon a rock,</hi> Pſal. 27.5. Gods <hi>Sanctuary</hi> is his <hi>hidden</hi> place, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.22. and his <hi>Saints</hi> are his <hi>hidden ones, Pſal.</hi> 83.4. and there he hides them from whatſoever may hurt them: therefore he calls his children, when it rains abroad and is ſtormy, to come within doors out of the wet; <hi>Come my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and ſhut thy doors upon thee, and hide thy ſelf, as it were, for a little moment, until the indignation be over paſt,</hi> Iſai. 26.20.</p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:100701:71"/>
               <p>The Chriſtian therefore is encouraged againſt evils, becauſe God is his guard; he knoweth whilſt he hath this <hi>buckter,</hi> he is ſhot-free, not to be pierced by any <hi>bullet; He covereth him with his feathers, and under his wings doth the Saint truſt,</hi> Pſal. 91.4. As the Hen ſecureth her young from the Kite and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous fowls by clucking them under her wing, and ſheltering them there: ſo God doth undertake to be the protection of his people; and through his ſtrength they can triumph over tryals, and defie the greateſt dangers. <hi>At deſtruction and famine they can laugh, Job</hi> 5, 22. and over the greateſt croſſes through him they are more then <hi>Conquerours, Rom.</hi> 8.35.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As God is able to free from all evil, <hi>ſo to fill the ſoul with all good,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 God can fill a ſoul with all good.</note> therefore is its happineſs.

The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort which ariſeth from creatures is like the juice of ſome plums, which doth fill with wind, but yields no nouriſhment. He that ſits at the worlds table, when it is moſt largely ſpread, and fairly furniſhed, and feedeth moſt heartily on its fare, is as one that dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he eats, and when he awakes loe he is hungry. The beſt noiſe of earthly Muſicians can make but an empty ſound, which may a little pleaſe the <hi>ſenſes,</hi> but not in the leaſt ſatisfie the <hi>ſoul.</hi> The world hath but <hi>ſmall choice,</hi> and therefore makes us but <hi>ſmall chear;</hi> for as ſick and ſqueazie ſtomacks, we are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:100701:71"/> cloyd even with that which we called ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly for. Hence it was, that thoſe who eſteemed their happineſs to conſiſt in pleaſing their brutiſh part, did ſo vehemently deſire new carnall delights. <hi>Nero</hi> had his officer that was ſtilled <hi>Arbiter Neronanae libi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinis An inventer of new pleaſures.</hi>

                  <hi>The God of peace fill you with all joy, Rome</hi> 15.19. Obſerve, here is <hi>joy</hi> which is the cream of our deſires, &amp; the overflowing of our delights; it is the ſweet tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of our mindes, the quiet repoſe of our hearts; and as the ſun to the flowers, it enlargeth, and cheereth our affections. Joy is the mark which all would hit; And is by the Philoſopher well obſerved to be the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the heart for its embracing of, cloſing with, &amp; Union to its moſt beloved object. 2 Here is all joy; Variety of what is excellent addeth much to its luſtre and beauty. The Chriſtian ſits at a banquet made up of all ſorts of rare and curious wines, and all manner of dainties and delicates; He may walk in this gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and delight himſelf with diverſity of pleaſant fruits and flowers. All joy. One kind of delight like <hi>Maryes</hi> box of Oyntment, being opened, filleth the whole houſe with its ſavor; what then will all ſorts of precious perfumes, and fragrant oyntments do? 3. Here is <hi>filling them with all joy; Plenty</hi> joyned with variety of that which is ſo excedingly <hi>pleaſant,</hi> muſt needs inhance its <hi>price;</hi> there is not a crevice in the heart of a Chriſtian, into which this light doth not come. Its able to fill him, were he a far larger Veſſel then he is, (as they fill'd the pots at the feaſt of <hi>Cana) up to the brim</hi> (with this water or rather) with this wine.

Truly this light of joy doth not ſpring out of the earth; its Fountain is in heaven; <hi>The God of peace</hi> fill you with all joy.

                  </gap> accommodated to their ſeveral natures.

The <hi>Oxe</hi> feedeth on <hi>graſſe,</hi> the <hi>Lion</hi> on <hi>fleſh,</hi> the <hi>Goat</hi> on <hi>Bough</hi>'s; ſome live on the <hi>dew,</hi> ſome on <hi>fruit,</hi> ſome on <hi>weeds;</hi> ſome creatures live in the <hi>Air,</hi> others ſport themſelves in the <hi>waters;</hi> the Mole and Worm are for the <hi>earth:</hi> the <hi>Salamander</hi> choſeth rather the fire; Nay in the ſame plant, the <hi>bee</hi> feedeth on the <hi>flower,</hi> the <hi>bird</hi> on the <hi>ſeed;</hi> the <hi>ſheep</hi> on the <hi>blade,</hi> and the <hi>ſwine</hi> on the <hi>root;</hi> and what is the reaſon of all this, but becauſe nature muſt have its reſt and delight from that only which is ſutable to its own appetite and deſire. Hence it is that though God be ſo perfect a good, yet he is not the happineſs of evil Men, or evil Angels, for he is not ſutable to their vitiated depraved natures. The car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mind (which beareth ſway in unregenerate men) is enmity againſt God, and Devils are as contrary to Gods nature, as fire is to water. Hence it is, that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual men place and enjoy happineſs in the Father of Spirits, becauſe he is the ſavoury meat which their ſouls love. Though the ſinner can live upon dregs, as the ſwine on dung; yet the Saint muſt have refined Spirits, and nothing leſſe then Angels food and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights.</p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:100701:73"/>
               <p>It is an unqueſtionable truth, that nothing can give true comfort to man, but that which hath a relation and beareth a proportion to his higheſt and nobleſt part, <hi>his immortal ſoul</hi> (for his ſenſitive faculties were created in him, to be ſubordinate and ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their Maſter <hi>Reaſon;</hi> therefore he is excelled in them by his inferiours, as the Eagle in ſeeing, and the Hound in ſcenting; nature aiming at ſome more ſublime and excellent deſign, the perfection of the rational part, in thoſe lower particulars was leſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act) therefore the bleſſed God alone being a ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Good to the heavenly ſpiritual ſoul of man, can only ſatisfie it. Philoſophers tell us the reaſon of the irons cleaving to, and reſting in the load-ſtone, is, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe the pores of both bodies are alike; ſo there are effluxes and emanations that ſlide through them and unite them together. One cauſe of the Saints love to, and delight in God, is his likeneſs to God. Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are <hi>earthly,</hi> the ſoul is <hi>heavenly,</hi> they are <hi>corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real,</hi> the ſoul is <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> therefore (as when friends are contrary in diſpoſition) the ſoul cannot take up its reſt and happineſs in their fruition; but God is ſutable, and therefore ſatisfying, <hi>I am God All ſufficient,</hi> Gen. 17.1. Some derive the word <hi>Shaddai</hi> from Almighty, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, from <hi>ſhad</hi> a <hi>dug;</hi> for as the breaſt is ſutable to the Babe nothing elſe will quiet it, ſo is God to his Children.</p>

               <p>The Saint in the ſharpeſt <hi>winter</hi> ſits at a good fire; when abuſed by <hi>ſtrangers,</hi> he can complain to,<note place="margin">Uſe inform. 1.</note> and comfort himſelf in his Father; though <hi>ſtars</hi> vaniſh out of ſight, he can rejoyce in the <hi>Sun;</hi> like the prudent Dame whitherſoever he travelleth, (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how liable he is to fainting-fits) he carrieth his bottle of ſtrong-waters along with him. <hi>When thou paſſeſt through the fire, I will be with thee, Iſa.</hi> 43.

               <p>The Godly man may be rob'd of his poſſeſſions, but he is well ſo long as he hath his happineſs, his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Lazarus</hi> was happy when (<hi>ſine domo,</hi> becauſe he was not <hi>ſine domino) without Goods,</hi> becauſe he was not <hi>without God.</hi> As he in <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> Though they had neither <hi>wine</hi> nor <hi>muſick,</hi> yet they had the <hi>Gods.</hi> The Prophet when the <hi>ponds</hi> were dried up, fetchd his water from the Fountain, <hi>Habakkuk</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>Although the Figge tree ſhall not bloſſome, neither ſhall fruit be in the vine; the labour of the Olives ſhall fayl, and the fieldes ſhall yeild no meat; the flock ſhall be cut off from the fold, and there ſhall be no herd in the ſtalls; yet will I rejoyce in the Lord, and I will joy in the God of my Salvation.</hi> Its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable that he expreſſeth not only things for <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency,</hi> as the <hi>Vine</hi> and <hi>Figge tree,</hi> but things for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, as the <hi>meat of the field,</hi> and <hi>flocks of the ſtall;</hi> and ſuppoſeth the totall loſs of both: yet in the want and abſence of ſuch <hi>comforts of life,</hi> he ſupports him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with God, the <hi>life of all his comforts.</hi> But <hi>the

Alas poor Soul, had the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> been his <hi>burden,</hi> and God ſtrengthened his <hi>back,</hi> all had been well, he might have gone lightly under it; but when Enemies approached, and God depaated, he muſt needs be greatly diſtreſſed. The Creature may well be full of frights and feares, that ſtands in the open fields where bullets flie thick and faſt, without any ſhelter or defence. <hi>Davids</hi> foes had proved their <hi>concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to the full, had their <hi>medium</hi> been true, <hi>Perſecute and take him, for God hath forſaken him.

No wonder that <hi>Micah</hi> cried out ſo mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, <hi>Ye have taken away my gods, and doe you ask me what I ail?</hi> At the loſs of his falſe God, much more will the loſs of the true God make men mournful.

               <p>Vaſt is the difference betwixt the caſe of the good and bad in diſtreſs; the former as cloaths <hi>died in grain,</hi> may keep his colour in all weathers; the latter like <hi>quick ſilver</hi> may well be ever in motion, and like a <hi>leaf</hi> tremble at the ſmalleſt <hi>wind.</hi> Naturaliſts obſerve this difference between <hi>Eagles</hi> and other
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:100701:78"/> Birds are in want, and diſtreſs, they make a <hi>pitiful noiſe;</hi> but the Eagle when in ſtraights, hath no ſuch mournful note, but mounteth aloft, and refreſheth her ſelf with the <hi>warm beames</hi> of the Sun. Saints like true Eagles when they are in neceſſity, mount up to God, upon the wings of Faith and Prayer; and delight themſelves with the golden raies, and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous influences of his favour; but the ſinner if bereft of outward comforts, dolefully complains. The <hi>ſnail,</hi> take him out of his <hi>ſhell,</hi> and he <hi>dieth</hi> preſently; the godleſs perſon is like the <hi>Ferret</hi> which hath its name in Hebrew from <hi>ſqueaking</hi> and <hi>crying,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſqueaketh ſadly, if taken from his prey: when the godly man (as <hi>Paulinus Molanus</hi> when his City was plundred by the <hi>Barbarians</hi>) though he be robd of his earthly riches, hath a Treaſure in Heaven; and may ſay, <hi>Domine, ne excrucier ob aurum &amp; ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentum; tu enim mihi es omnia.

Snares take men at unawares: The ſinners <hi>woe</hi> ſhall come without <hi>warning.

               </p>
               <p>Now let us caſt up the account, and ſee what the worldlings portion amounts to, and how much he will be worth in the other world: The liquor in his cup is moſt painful and loathſome, <hi>fire and brimſtone.</hi> (All his eſtate lyeth in the valley of the ſhadow of death:) <hi>Scalding lead</hi> were a wonderful favour, if he might drink that inſtead of boyling brimſtone.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:100701:83"/> No heart can conceive what a terrible potion that is, which a God boundleſs in wiſdome, power and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, doth prepare: yet though it be <hi>dreadful,</hi> if it were doubtful, the ſinners <hi>grief</hi> would not be ſo <hi>great;</hi> but as the liquor is moſt loathſome, ſo the cup is moſt certain; God will poure this dreadful drench down his throat.

               <p>The cup which he ſhall drink of, is filled out of the rivers of Gods <hi>own pleaſures;</hi> and how ſweet that wine is, none can tell but they who have taſted it.

               <p>I ſhall try thee very briefly by the touchſtone which Chriſt hath prepared: <hi>Where your treaſure is, there will your heart be alſo, Matth.</hi> 6. Now Friend, Where is thy <hi>heart?</hi> is it in earth? is it a <hi>diamond</hi> ſet in <hi>lead,</hi> or a ſparkling <hi>ſtar</hi> fixt in <hi>heaven?</hi> Are thy greateſt affections like <hi>Saul</hi>'s perſon among the ſtuffe and rubbiſh of this world? or do they, like <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:100701:85"/> go up into the Mount and converſe with God? Do they with the Wormes crawl here below? or like the Eagle ſoar aloft and dwell above? A man that hath his portion on earth, like the earth, moveth down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, though he may be thrown upward by violence (as a ſtone) by ſome ſudden conviction, or the like; yet that impreſt vertue is ſoon worn out, and he fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to the earth again; but he who hath his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in heaven, like fire, tendeth upward ordinarily, though through the violence of temptation he may (as fire by the wind) be forced downward, yet that removed, he aſcendeth again.</p>
               <p>It may be when thine enemy <hi>Death</hi> beats thee out of the field of life, thou wilt be glad of a God, to which thou mayſt retire, as <hi>a city of refuge,</hi> to ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thee from the murdering piece of the laws curſe; but what thoughts haſt thou of him now, whilſt thou haſt the world at will? Doſt thou count the fruition of him thy chiefeſt felicity? Is one God infinitely more weighty in the ſcales of thy judgement then millions of <hi>worlds?</hi> Doſt thou ſay in thy prevailing ſetled judgement, of them that have their garners full and their floeks fruitful, <hi>Bleſſed is the people that is in ſuch a caſe;</hi> or <hi>yea rather happy is the people whoſe God is the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 144.13, 14, 15.</p>
               <p>Every man eſteemeth his portion at an high price: <hi>Naboth</hi> valueth his earthly inheritance above his life, and would rather die then part with it at any rate: <hi>God forbid that I ſhould ſell the inheritance of my fathers,</hi> ſaith he. O the worth of the bleſſed God, in the eſteem of him that hath him for his portion! His houſe, land, wife, child, liberty, life, are hated by him, and nothing to him in compariſon of his portions he
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:100701:85"/> would not exchange his hopes of it and title to it for the dominion and ſoveraignty of the whole world. If the Devil, as to Chriſt, ſhould ſet him on the pina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Temple, and ſhew all the honours, and pleaſures, and treaſures of the world, and ſay to him, <hi>All this I will give thee, if thou wilt ſell thy portion and fall down and worſhip me:</hi> Who can tell with what infinite diſdain he would reject ſuch an offer? He would ſay as a Tradeſman that were bid exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly below the worth of his wares, <hi>You were as good bid me nothing,</hi> and with much ſcorn and laughter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe his tender. This man is elevated to the top of the celeſtial orbes, and therefore the whole earth is but a point in his eye: whereas a man who hath his portion in outward things, who dwelleth here on earth, heavenly things are little (the glorious Sun it ſelf is but ſmall) in ſuch a mans eye, earthly things are great in his eſteem.</p>
               <p>Reader, let me perſwade thee to be ſo much at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as to ask thy ſoul two or three Queſtions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In what chanel doth the ſtream of thy deſires run?</hi> Which way and to what coaſt do theſe winds of thy ſoul drive? Is it towards God, or towards the world?

Doſt thou like the dry earth, gape and cleave for ſhowers to bring forth corn and wine? Is the voice of thy heart, <hi>Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> or is it, <hi>Lord, lift up the light of thy countenance</hi> on us? Phyſitians can judge conſiderably of the ſtate of their Patients bodies, by their <hi>appetites;</hi> they who long only for traſh, ſpeak their ſtomacks to be foul; they who hunger after wholſome food are eſteemed to be in health. Thou mayſt judge of the ſtate of thy ſoul by thy <hi>deſires;</hi> if thou deſireſt chiefly the traſh of the world, thy ſpiritual ſtate is not right; thy heart is not right in the ſight of God; if thou canſt ſay with <hi>David, Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I deſire in compariſon of thee:</hi> Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed art thou of the Lord, thou haſt a part and lot in this boundleſs portion. Obſerve therefore Friend, which way theſe wings of thy ſoul, thy deſires, flie. He who thirſteth after the kennel water of this world hath no right to the pure river of the water of life; but he who hungreth after the dainties of the Lambs Supper, may be ſure the ſcraps of this beggarly world are not his happineſs: The true Wife longeth for the return of her Husband, but the falſe one careth not how long he is abſent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What is the feaſt at which thou ſitteſt with moſt delight?</hi> Is it at a table furniſhed with the comforts of this world? Are the diſhes of credit and profit, of relations and poſſeſſions, thoſe which thou feedeſt on
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:100701:86"/> with moſt pleaſure? Or is it a Table ſpread with the Image of God, the Favour of God, the Spirit of God, and the Son of God? are thoſe the ſavoury meat which thy Soul loveth?</p>
               <p>If this Sun of righteouſneſs only cauſeth day in thine heart, when he ariſeth; and if he be ſet, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the candles of creatures, it is ſtill night with thee, then God is thy Portion. O how glad is the young Heir, when he comes to enjoy his Portion! with what delight will he look over his woods, view his grounds, and walk in his gardens. The <hi>Roman</hi> would tumble naked in his heapes of Silver, out of delight in them; but if thy affections only overflow with joy (as the water of <hi>Nilus</hi>) in the time of <hi>wheat harveſt,</hi> when the world floweth in upon thee, the world is thy Portion. He who like a Lark ſings merrily, (not on the ground) but when he is mounting up to Heaven, is rich indeed. God is his; but he who like an horſefly delighteth in dunghils, feedeth moſt on, &amp; relliſheth beſt theſe earth ly offalls, is a poor man; God is none of his God; its an undeniable truth, that, <hi>that is our Portion which is the Paradiſe of our pleaſures.</hi> The fool who could expect eaſe on his bed of Thorns, <hi>Soul take thine eaſe, thou haſt goods laid up for many years,</hi> had his Portion in this life; but <hi>Moſes</hi> whom nothing could pleaſe but Gods gracious preſence, had him for his Portion. <hi>If thy preſence go not with us, carry us not hence,</hi> I beſeech me ſhew me thy glory.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>What is the calling which thou followeſt, with greateſt eagerneſs and earneſtneſs?</hi> Men run and ride and toyl and moyl all day, they riſe early and go to bed late, and take any pains for that
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:100701:87"/> which they count their happineſs and portion. The Worldling whoſe Element is Earth, whoſe Portion conſiſteth like the Pedlars pack, in a few pins, or nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, or peuter-ſpoons, or braſs-bodkins, how will he fare mean, lodg hard, ſleep little, crowd into a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; hazard his health, and life and ſoul too, for that which he counteth his Portion! like a brutiſh ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel he will follow his Maſter the world ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of miles, puffing and blowing, breaking through hedges, and ſcratching himſelf with thorns and briers, running through ponds of water, and puddles of dirt; and all for a few bones or ſcraps, which is all his hope and happineſs. The Chriſtian who hath the bleſſed God for his portion, ſtrives, and labours, and watcheth, and prayeth, and weepeth, and thinks no time too much, no pains too great, no coſt enough for the enjoyment of his God. As the wiſe Merchant he would part with <hi>All</hi> he hath, all his ſtrength and health, all his relations and poſſeſſions, for his noble Portion. Reader, how is it with thee, thou travelleſt too and fro, thou wearieſt thy ſelf, and wanteſt thy reſt, thy head is full of cares, and thy heart of feares, and thy hands are alwaies active; but whether doth all this tend? what is the market to which thou art walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus faſt? Is it gold that thou purſueſt ſo hot? <hi>The people labour in the fire; and weary themſelves for very vanity.</hi> 2. <hi>Habbak.</hi> 13.

               <p>If upon tryall thou findeſt that God is thy Portion, rejoyce in thy priviledg, and let thy practices be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable.

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:100701:88"/> the poor, who take almes of the Pariſh. Thou ough'ſt to live above the world; Eagles muſt not ſtoop to catch flies; the ſtars which are neareſt the Pole, have leaſt circuit. Thou who art ſo near God, need'ſt not wander about this world, but ſhould'ſt live as one whoſe hope and happineſs is in a better world. When one was askt whether he did not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the admirable ſtructure of ſome ſtately building: No (ſaith he) <hi>for I have been at</hi> Rome <hi>where better are to be ſeen every day.</hi> If the world tempt thee with its rare ſights, and curious proſpects, thou maiſt well ſcorn them, having been in Heaven, and being able by Faith to ſee infinitely better every hour of the day; but if upon examination it be found that God is not thy portion, think of it ſeriouſly, thou art but a <hi>beggar;</hi> and if thou dieſt in this eſtate, ſhalt be ſo for <hi>ever.</hi> It may be thou art worth thouſands in this world, but alas they ſtand for cyphers in the other world; how little will thy bags of ſilver in thy cheſt be worth, when thou entereſt into thy Coffin!

               <p>THe third uſe which I ſhall make of this doctrine, ſhall be by way of Exhortation.<note place="margin">3. Vſe, chooſe God for thy Portion.</note> If the comfort of a Chriſtian in his ſaddeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition be this, that God is his portion; <hi>let me then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thee</hi> Reader, <hi>to choſe God for thy portion.</hi> I look on thee as rational, and accordingly ſhall treat thee in this uſe, not doubting, but if reaſon may be judge, I ſhall prevail with thee to repent of thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and reſolve on a new choice. Thou art one who haſt choſen the world for thy portion; but haſt thou not read what a poor, what a pitiful, what a piercing, what a periſhing portion it is? <hi>why then doſt thou ſpend thy ſtrength for what is not bread, and thy labour for what will not ſatisfy. Hearken to me and eat that which is good; and let thy ſoul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light it ſelf in fatneſs.</hi> I offer thee this day a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion worthy of thy choiceſt affections, a portion that if thou accepteſt, the richeſt Emperors will be but beggars to thee, a portion which containeth more wealth then Heaven and Earth; nay ten thouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and worlds are nothing in compariſon of this portion.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:100701:89"/> If a man ſhould offer thee a bagg of gold, and a bagg of <hi>counters;</hi> a bagg of <hi>pearls,</hi> and a bagg of <hi>ſand;</hi> which wouldeſt thou chooſe? ſurely the former. The world in compariſon of God is infinitely leſs then braſs to gold, or ſand to pearles, and wilt thou not chooſe him for thy portion? Didſt thou never laugh at Children for their folly, in chooſing rattles, and babies, before things of much greater worth. And art thou not a bigger child, and a greater fool to chooſe <hi>husks</hi> before <hi>bread,</hi> a <hi>meſs of pottage</hi> before the <hi>birthright,</hi> the bleſſing! to chooſe a <hi>ſeeming fancy,</hi> before <hi>reall felicities!</hi> a little <hi>honour</hi> (which is but a farthing candle that children can puffe out with one breath, and blow in with another blaſt) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>exceeding and eternall weight of glory!</hi> to chooſe <hi>broken Ciſterns</hi> before a <hi>fountain</hi> of living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>dirt</hi> before <hi>Diamonds, vanity</hi> before <hi>ſolidity, drops</hi> before the <hi>Ocean,</hi> and <hi>nothing</hi> before <hi>all things!</hi> Man, where is thy reaſon! <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid to <hi>Saul, Set not thine heart on aſſes; for is not the deſire of all</hi> Iſrael <hi>to thee?</hi> Friend, why ſhould'ſt thou ſet thy heart on aſſes, or thy flock, or ſhop, or any treaſure, when thou haſt <hi>the deſire of all Nations to ſet thine heart upon?</hi> As Chriſt ſaid to the woman of <hi>Canaan, If thou kneweſt the gift of God, and who is that ſpeaketh to thee, thou wouldſt aske of him, and he would give thee living water.</hi> John 4.10. So ſay I to thee, <hi>If thou kneweſt the bleſſed God, and who it is, that is offered to thee (the ſweeteſt love, the richeſt mercy, the ſureſt friend, the cheifeſt good, the greateſt beauty, the higheſt honour,</hi> and <hi>the fulleſt happineſs) thou wouldſt leave the colliers of this world, to load them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with thick clay, and turn Merchant Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:100701:89"/> for the other world; thou wouldſt more willingly leave theſe frothy joys and droſſie delights for the enjoyment of God, then ever priſoner did the fetters, and bondage, and miſery of a goal, for the liberty, and pleaſures, and preferments of a Court. Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks of a time when he and his mother were diſcourſing together of the comforts of the Spirit: <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>thou knoweſt in that day how wiſely we did eſteem of the world, and all its delights.</hi> O Reader, couldſt thou but ſee the vaſtneſs, the ſutableneſs, and the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this portion, I am confident thou wouldſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the natives, <hi>the men of this world,</hi> Pſal. 17.14. to mind the commodities which are of the growth of their own Country, and wouldſt fetch thy riches (as the good houſewife her food) from far.</p>
               <p>The cauſe of thy wrong choice (I mean, thy ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the world all this while for thy portion) is thy ignorance of the worth and excellency of this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which I am offering to thee. 'Tis in the <hi>dark</hi> that men <hi>grope</hi> ſo much about <hi>preſent things,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. Knowing perſons prefer <hi>wiſdome</hi> before <hi>ſilver,</hi> before <hi>choice gold,</hi> nay before <hi>rubies, Prov.</hi> 3.14, 15. Every one will ſell his heart to that chapman which biddeth moſt: now the Devil he courts man for his ſoul with the brutiſh pleaſures of ſin: the world wooeth for the heart with its proffer of treaſures and honours, which like it ſelf are vain, vexatious and periſhing: God comes, and he offereth for the heart, the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blood of his Son, the curious embroydery of his Spirit, the noble employment and honourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment of Angels, fulneſs of joy, and infiniteneſs of ſatisfaction, in the fruition of his bleſſed ſelf to all eternity. Now what is the reaſon that the Devils
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:100701:90"/> money is accepted, and the worlds offer embraced, and Gods tender (which is farther ſuperiour to theirs, then the glorious heavens where the King of Saints keeps his Court, and ſheweth all his State, and Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, and Magnificence, is to a ſtinking dunghil) ſhould be rejected? Truly nothing but this, <hi>Men know not the worth of what God biddeth them for their wares.</hi> The money which the devil and world offer are their own <hi>country coin,</hi> and a little of this they ſooner take becauſe they know it, then much more of another Nations, the value of which they do not underſtand. Swine trample on Pearls becauſe they know not the worth of them. None look off the world, but they that can look beyond it.</p>
               <p>The Turtle, ſaith the Philoſopher, brings forth her young blind. The moſt quick-ſighted Chriſtian brings forth blind children; now they not being able to ſee afar off into the other world, prefer theſe poor things, which they may have in preſent poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, before theſe unſearchable riches which are offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in reverſion. Hence it is alſo, that the Devil (as the Raven when he ſeizeth the carcaſs) as ſoon as he layeth hold on any perſon,<note place="margin">Prov. 33.17. 2 Cor. 4.4</note> the firſt thing he doth is to peck out his eyes, knowing, that as ſoon as they come to ſee the bleſſed God, and the happineſs which is to be enjoyed in him, they will quickly turn their backs on theſe ſhadows, and face about towards this eternal ſubſtance. O how dull would the worlds <hi>common glaſſe</hi> be in his eye, who had once beheld the <hi>true Chriſtal!</hi> The <hi>loadſtone</hi> of earth will not draw mans affections whilſt this <hi>Diamond</hi> of heaven is in preſence. When <hi>Moſes</hi> had once ſeen him that was inviſible, how low did the price of the honours, and

Knowledge is by one well expreſſed to be Appetites taſter; for as he that hath eaten ſweet-meats cannot relliſh the ſtrongeſt beer; ſo he that hath fed on the heavenly banquet, cannot ſavour any thing elſe.</p>
               <p>A man that is born in a <hi>dark dungeon,</hi> and there continueth a long time, when he comes, after twelve or fourteen years to ſee a <hi>candle,</hi> he wonders at the excellency of that Creature; what delight will he take in beholding it, and enquiring into the nature of it? But bring this man afterwards into the open air, and let him behold the <hi>glorious Sun,</hi> his admiration of the candle will ceaſe, and all his wonder will be at the beauty and glory of this great Luminary of the World. Every man is naturally in darkneſs: hence it is, that when he comes to behold the candles of creature comforts, he is ſo raviſht and taken with them: but let him once come to ſee <hi>the Sun of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> the Alſufficient and Eternal God, he deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth thoſe glimmering ruſhes, and all his wondering is at the excellency and perfections of this Glorious being. <hi>That which was glorious before, hath now no glory in compariſon of this glory that excelleth.</hi> All things are ſmall and little in his eye, who hath once had a ſight of the great God.

As <hi>Alexander,</hi> when he heard of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and the riches there, divided the Kingdome of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia</hi> amongſt his Captains; ſo thou wouldſt leave the ſwine of the earth to wallow in the mire of brutiſh comforts, the fooliſh children of diſobedience to paddle in the gutter of ſenſual waters: and wouldſt deſire that thy portion might be amongſt Gods Children, and thy heritage amongſt his choſen ones: Then, then, Friend, all thy love would be too little, and no labour too great (wouldſt thou think) for ſuch a peerleſs and ineſtimable portion.

Could I by my prayer move God to open thine eyes (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet did for his ſervant, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.) to ſee the worth and worthineſſe, the love and lovelineſſe of this portion, thou ſhouldſt not an hour longer be alienated from the life of God, through the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that is in thee. But be of good comfort: Read on, he that made the ſeeing eye, is willing to open the eyes of the blind, and thou mayſt poſſibly, before thou art come to the end of the book, meet with that eye-ſalve of the Sanctuary which may doe the work.</p>
               <p>What I have farther to offer to thee in relation to this choice, ſhall be to encourage thee to it by four <hi>properties</hi> of this <hi>portion.</hi> In the handling of which, I ſhall put the world in one ſcale, with all its mines of gold, and allow them as many grains as can be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and put this One God in the other ſcale, and then leave thy own reaſon to judge which ſcale is moſt weighty.</p>

               <p>Men that are in the <hi>valley,</hi> think, if they were at the top of ſuch a <hi>hill,</hi> they ſhould touch the <hi>beavens:</hi> Men that are in the <hi>bottome</hi> of <hi>poverty,</hi> or <hi>diſgrace</hi> or pain, think, if they could get up to ſuch a <hi>mountain,</hi> ſuch a meaſure of riches, and honours, and delights,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:100701:95"/> they could reach happineſs. Now <hi>Solomon</hi> had got to the top of this hill, and ſeeing ſo many ſcrambling and labouring ſo hard, nay riding on one anothers necks, and preſſing one another to death to get fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, doth ſeem thus to beſpeak them; <hi>Sirs, ye are all deceived in your expectations; I ſee the pains ye take to get up to this place, thinking, that when you come hither, ye ſhall touch the heavens, and reach happineſs; but I am before you at the top of the hill, (I have treaſures, and honours, and pleaſures in variety and abundance</hi>) Eccleſ. 2.12, 13. <hi>and I find the hill full of quagmires inſtead of delights, and ſo far from giving me ſatisfaction, that it cauſeth much vexation; therefore be adviſed to ſpare your pains, and ſpend your ſtrength for that which will turn to more profit: for believe it, you do but work at the labour in vain; Vanity of vanities, all is vanitie, ſaith the Preacher.</hi>

               <p>We have weighed the world in the ballance and found it lighter then vanity; let us ſee what weight God hath. <hi>David</hi> will tell us, though the veſſel of the creature be frozen, that no ſatisfaction can be drawn thence; yet this Fountain runneth freely to the full content of all true Chriſtians; <hi>The Lord is the portion of my cup, and inheritance; thou maintaineſt my lot.</hi> The former expreſſion, as I obſerved before, is an alluſion to the cuſtome of dividing their drink at banquets; the latter to the diviſion of <hi>Canaan</hi> by lot and line, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.55. according as the lot fell, was every ones part. Now <hi>Davids</hi> part and lot fell it ſeems (like the Levites under the Law) on God; but is he pleaſed in his portion, and can he take any delight in his eſtate? <hi>The lines are fallen to me in a
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:100701:96"/> pleaſant place;</hi> yea <hi>I have a goodly heritage</hi> Pſalm 16.5, 6. As if he had ſaid, <hi>No lot ever fell in a better land; my portion happeneth in the beſt place that is poſſible; my knowledge of thee, and propriety in thee affordeth full content and felicity to me. I have enough, and crave no more; I have all, and can have no more.</hi> Though creatures bring in an <hi>Ignoramus</hi> to that enquiry concerning ſatisfaction, yet the Alſufficient God doth not.</p>
               <p>If it were poſſible for one man to be crowned with the <hi>royal Diadem</hi> and dominion of the whole world, and to enjoy all the treaſures, and honours, and pleaſures that all the Kingdomes on earth can yield, if his ſenſes and underſtanding were enlarged to the utmoſt of created capacities, to taſte and take in whatſoever comfort and delight the Univerſe can give; if he had the ſociety of glorious Angels and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Saints thrown into the bargain, and might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy all this the whole length of the worlds duration; yet without God would this man in the midſt of all this be unſatisfied; (theſe things, like <hi>dew,</hi> might wet the <hi>branches,</hi> pleaſe the fleſh, but would leave the <hi>root</hi> drie, the ſpirit diſcontented) once admit the man to the ſight of God, and let God but poſſeſs his heart, and then, and not before, his infinite deſires ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in the boſome of his Maker. Now the weary <hi>Dove</hi> is at <hi>reſt,</hi> and the veſſel toſt up and down on the waters, is quiet in its haven. There is in the heart of man ſuch a drought (without this River of Paradiſe) that all the waters in the world, though every drop were an Ocean, cannot quench it. O what dry chips are all creatures to an hungry immortal ſoul! <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auſtine, thou haſt made our heart for thee, and

               <p>There are two ſpecial faculties in Mans Soul, which muſt be anſwered with ſutable and adaequate objects, or the heart (like the ſea) cannot reſt. The <hi>underſtanding</hi> muſt be ſatisfied with <hi>truth,</hi> and the <hi>will</hi> with <hi>good.</hi> For the filling of theſe two faculties men are as <hi>buſie</hi> as <hi>Bees,</hi> flying over the <hi>field</hi> of the world, and trying every <hi>flower</hi> for <hi>ſweetneſs;</hi> but after all their toyl and labour, houſe themſelves like <hi>waſps</hi> in curious <hi>combs</hi> without any hony. The <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding</hi> muſt be ſuted with the higheſt <hi>truth;</hi> but the world is a <hi>lye, Pſal.</hi> 62. and the things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are called <hi>lying vanities,</hi> they are not what they ſeem to be. <hi>Jonah.</hi> 2.8. and hence are unable to ſatisfy the mind; but God is <hi>aeterna veritas, &amp; vera aeternitas, eternal truth, and true eternity.</hi> All truth is originally in him; his nature is the Idea of truth, and his will the ſtandard of truth; and its eternal life and utmoſt ſatisfaction to know him, becauſe by it the underſtanding is perfected; for the Soul in God will ſee all truth; and that not only clearly (I ſpeak of the other world where the Chriſtians happineſs ſhall be completed) <hi>face to face,</hi> but alſo fully. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> though an Heathen, thought happineſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the knowledg of the chiefeſt good. If <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimedes</hi> when he found out the reſolution of one queſtion in the Mathematicks was ſo raviſhed that he ran up and down crying <hi>I have found it, I have found it.</hi> How will the Chriſtian be tranſported when he ſhall know all that is knowable, and all ſhadows of ignorance vaniſh as the darkneſs before the riſing Sun. The <hi>will</hi> alſo muſt be ſuted with <hi>good</hi> and according
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:100701:97"/> to the degree of <hi>goodneſs</hi> in the object, ſuch is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> to the faculty. Now the things of this life, though good in themſelves, yet are vain and evill by reaſon of the ſin of man. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.20. And likewiſe are at beſt but bodily, limited, and fading good things; and therefore uncapable of filling this faculty. As <hi>truth</hi> in the utmoſt latitude is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the <hi>underſtanding;</hi> ſo <hi>Good</hi> in the univerſality of it is the object of the <hi>will.</hi> Further that good which ſatisfieth, muſt be <hi>(optimum)</hi> the beſt, or twill never <hi>(ſiſtere appetitum)</hi> the Soul will otherwiſe be ſtill longing; and <hi>maximum</hi> the moſt perfect, or twill never <hi>(implere appetitum)</hi> fill it. But God is ſuch a good, he is eſſentially, univerſally, unchangeably, and infinitely good; and therefore ſatisfieth. <hi>When I awake I ſhall be ſatisfied with thy likeneſs. Pſa.</hi> 17. <hi>ult. When my body hath ſlept in the bed of the grave, till the morning of the reſurrection, and the ſound of the laſt trump ſhall awaken me, O the ſweet ſatisfaction and raviſhing delight which my Soul ſhall enjoy in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full of thy likeneſs, and thy love!</hi> Nay in the <hi>mean time</hi> before the happineſs of a Saint appear to his view in a full body, it doth like the riſing Sun, with its forerunning rays, caſt ſuch a lightſome, glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome brightneſs upon the believer, that he is filled with joy at preſent; and would not part with his hopes of it for the whole world in hand. <hi>They ſhall be abundantly ſatisfied with the fatneſs of thy houſe</hi> (while on this ſide Heaven) and <hi>thou ſhalt make them drink of the rivers of thy pleaſures. Pſal.</hi> 36.8. Though the <hi>wedding dinner</hi> be deferd till the <hi>wedd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day,</hi> yet before hand the Chriſtian meets with many a <hi>running banquet.</hi> He hath not only pleaſures,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:100701:97"/> 
                  <hi>fatneſs of thy houſe,</hi> but alſo plenty of it here below. <hi>They ſhall be abundantly ſatisfied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The World is like ſharp ſauce which doth not fill, but provoke the ſtomach to call for more; the voice of thoſe gueſts whom it makes moſt welcome, is like the daughters of the horſeleech, <hi>Give, Give,</hi> but the infinite God like ſolid food doth ſatisfy the ſoul fully. <hi>(In my Fathers houſe is bread enough)</hi> and cauſeth it to cry out, <hi>I have enough.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, God is a <hi>ſanctifying ennobling Portion.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 God is a ſanctifying por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> The World cannot advance the Soul in the leaſt; things of the World are fitly compared to <hi>ſhadows;</hi> for be thy <hi>ſhadow</hi> never ſo long, thy body is not the longer for it; ſo be thy <hi>eſtate</hi> never ſo great, thy <hi>ſoul</hi> is not the better for it.

               <p>That which doth <hi>elevate</hi> &amp; ennoble the Soul of Man, muſt be more <hi>excellent</hi> then the Soul. <hi>Silver</hi> is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed by mixing it with <hi>lead,</hi> but ennobled by <hi>gold,</hi> becauſe the former is inferiour to it, but the latter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells it. The World and all things in it are infinitely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the Soul of Man; and therefore it is deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by mingling with them; but God is infinitely ſuperiour, and ſo advanceth it by joyning with it. That coyn which is the moſt excellent mettal, defileth our hands; and is apt to defile our hearts; but the divine nature elevateth and purifieth the Spirit.</p>
               <p>The goodlieſt portions of this life, are like the Cities which <hi>Solomon</hi> gave to <hi>Hiram. And</hi> Hiram <hi>came from</hi> Tyre <hi>to ſee the Cities which</hi> Solomon <hi>had given him; and they pleaſed him not. And he ſaid, What Cities are theſe which thou haſt given me my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! and he called them the land of</hi> Cabul (that is diſpleaſing or dirty) unto this day. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.12, 13. The pleaſanteſt portion here lyeth in the <hi>land</hi> of <hi>Cabul,</hi> its <hi>diſpleaſing</hi> and <hi>dirty;</hi> it doth both diſſatisfy and defile, when the heavenly portion doth like hony both <hi>delight</hi> and <hi>cleanſe;</hi> both <hi>pleaſe</hi> and <hi>purify.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Outward things (like common ſtones to a ring) adde nothing at all to the worth of a Soul; but this ſparking Diamond, this pearle of price, the infinite God makes the gold ring of the Soul to be of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable value. The <hi>heart of the wicked is little worth. Pro.</hi> 10.20. His <hi>houſe</hi> is worth <hi>ſomewhat,</hi> but his <hi>heart</hi> is worth <hi>nothing,</hi> becauſe its a <hi>ditch</hi> full only of <hi>dirt;</hi> his earthly portion hath poſſeſſion of it;
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:100701:98"/> but the heart of a godly man is worth <hi>millions,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its the <hi>Cabinet</hi> where this ineſtimable <hi>jewell</hi> is laid up. <hi>The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour (Pro.</hi> 12.26.) becauſe he partaketh of the <hi>divine nature.</hi> God like gold enricheth whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he is joyned to; hence it is that things which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, in Scripture are uſually ſaid to be things <hi>of God,</hi> as the <hi>garden of God. Ezek.</hi> 28.13. <hi>The hill of God. Pſ,</hi> 61.15. The <hi>mountains of God. Pſ,</hi> 36.6. a <hi>city of God. Jonah</hi> 3.3. the <hi>cedars of God. Pſ.</hi> 80.10. That is, the moſt excellent garden, hill, mountain, city and cedars. God is the perfection of thy Soul; and therefore would (if thy portion) advance it to purpoſe. O what an height of honour and happineſs wouldſt thou arrive at, if this God were thine! Now like a <hi>worm</hi> thou crawleſt on, and dwelleſt in the earth, the meaneſt and baſeſt of all the Elements, that which brutes trample under their feet; but then like an <hi>Eagle</hi> thou wouldſt mount up to Heaven, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning theſe toys, and leaving thoſe babies for children, and as an Angel alwaies ſtand in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of, and enjoy inſpeakable pleaſure in him, who is thy portion. Thy life at preſent is <hi>low,</hi> little differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the life of a beaſt, conſiſting cheifly in making proviſion for (that which ſhould be thy ſlave) the <hi>fleſh,</hi> but thy life then would be high and noble, much reſembling the lives of thoſe honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Courtiers, whoſe continual <hi>practice</hi> is to adore and admire the <hi>bleſſed and only Potentate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doſt thou not find by experience that earthly things obſtruct holineſs, and thereby hinder thy Souls happineſs! Alas the beſt of them are but like the <hi>wings</hi> of a <hi>butterfly,</hi> which though curiouſly pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

                  </note>THirdly, God is a <hi>univerſal</hi> portion; God hath in himſelf <hi>eminently</hi> and <hi>infinitely</hi> all good things; and Creatures are bounded in their beings, and therefore in the comfort which they yeild. <hi>Health</hi> anſwereth <hi>ſickneſs,</hi> but it doth not anſwer <hi>poverty. Honour</hi> is an help againſt <hi>diſgrace,</hi> but not againſt <hi>pain;</hi> Money is the moſt <hi>univerſall</hi> medicines: and therefore is ſaid to <hi>anſwer all things,</hi> but as great a Monarch as it is, it can neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand eaſe in ſickneſs, nor honours in diſgrace, much leſs quiet a wounded ſpirit. At beſt Creatures are but <hi>particular beings,</hi> and ſo but <hi>particular bleſſings.</hi> Now man being a compound of <hi>many wants</hi> and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:100701:99"/> weakneſſes, can never be happy till he find a <hi>ſalve</hi> for every <hi>ſore;</hi> and a remedy which bears proportion as well to the number as nature of his maladies. <hi>Ahab</hi> though in his Ivory Pallace, upon his Throne of glory, attended with his noble Lords, and ſwaying a large Scepter, was miſerable becauſe the heavens were braſs. <hi>Haman</hi> though he had the favour of the Prince, the adoration of the people, the ſway of 127. Provinces, yet is diſcontented becauſe he wanted <hi>Mordecai's</hi> knee. If the worlds darlings enjoy many good things, yet they (as Chriſt told the young man) alwayes lack one thing which makes them at a loſs.</p>
               <p>But God is <hi>all</hi> good things, and <hi>every</hi> good thing; he is <hi>ſelf-ſufficient, alone-ſufficient,</hi> and <hi>all-ſufficient;</hi> nothing is wanting in him, either for the Souls pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from all evill, or perfection with all good. Reader, if God were thy portion, thou ſhouldſt find in him whatſoever thine heart could deſire, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever could tend to thy happineſs. Art thou <hi>ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious?</hi> he is a <hi>crown of Glory,</hi> and a <hi>royall Diadem.</hi> Art thou <hi>covetous?</hi> he is <hi>unſearchable riches,</hi> yea durable riches and <hi>righteouſneſs.</hi> Art thou <hi>voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous?</hi> He is <hi>rivers of pleaſures,</hi> and <hi>fulneſs of joy.</hi> Art thou <hi>hungry?</hi> He is a <hi>feaſt of wine on the lees, of fat things full of marrow.</hi> Art thou <hi>weary?</hi> He is <hi>reſt,</hi> a <hi>ſhadow</hi> from the heat, and a <hi>ſhelter</hi> from the ſtorm. Art thou <hi>weak? In the Lord</hi> Jehovah <hi>is everlaſting ſtrength.</hi> Art thou in <hi>doubts?</hi> he is <hi>marvellous in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell.</hi> Art thou in <hi>darkneſs?</hi> He is the <hi>Sun of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> an eternall <hi>light.</hi> Art thou <hi>ſick?</hi> He is the <hi>God of thy health.</hi> Art thou <hi>ſorrowfull?</hi> He is the <hi>God of all conſolations.</hi> Art thou <hi>dying?</hi> He is the <hi>fountain and Lord of life.</hi> Art thou in any diſtreſs?

If all the riches in the Covenant of Grace, if all the good things which Chriſt purchaſed with his precious blood; nay if as much good as is in an infinite God can make thee happy, thou ſhouldſt have it. If <hi>David</hi> were thought worth ten thouſand <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> how much is the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> worth?</p>
               <p>This one God would fill up thy ſoul in its utmoſt capacity; it is ſuch an end, that when thou attaineſt thou couldſt go no further, ſhouldſt deſire no more, but quietly reſt for ever. The neceſſity of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures number ſpeaks the meanneſs of their value, but the univerſality of good in this one God, proclaims his infinite worth. As there are all parts of ſpeech in that one verſe,

                  </gap>, a <hi>ſeaſon</hi> is a very ſhort ſpace, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.) but the portion of a Saint is for ever: <hi>God is the ſtrength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</hi> The greateſt eſtate here below is a flood ſoon up and ſoon down; but if God once ſay to thy ſoul as to <hi>Aarons, I am thine inheritance</hi> (Numb. 18.20.) <hi>neither men nor devils can cozen thee of it. The Lord knoweth the dayes of the upright, and their inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſhall be for ever,</hi> Pſal. 37.18.</p>
               <p>The Prodigal waſted his portion, and ſo came to poverty; the Glutton ſwalloweth down his portion, burying it in his belly; the Drunkard vomiteth up his portion; the ambitious perſon often turneth his portion into ſmoak, and it vaniſheth in the air; thoſe whoſe portion continueth longeſt, will be turned out of poſſeſſion, when Death once comes with a Writ from Heaven to ſeal a Leaſe of ejectment; for all theſe portions are dying gourds, deceitful brooks, and flying ſhadows. But ah! how contrary hereunto is the portion of a believer! God is an <hi>eternal</hi> portion. If he were once thy portion, he would be for ever thy portion: When thy eſtate, and children, and wife, and honours, and all earthly things ſhould be taken from thee: He is <hi>the good part which ſhall never be taken from thee,</hi> Luke 10. <hi>ult.</hi> Thy Friends may uſe thee as a ſuit of apparel, which when they have worn thredbare they throw off, and call for new: thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations may ſerve thee as women their flowers, who ſtick them in their boſomes when freſh and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but when dying and withered, they throw them to the dunghill; thy riches, and honours, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and wife, and children, may ſtand on the ſhore and ſee thee lanching into the Ocean of Eternity, but
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:100701:101"/> will not ſtep one foot into the water after thee; thou mayſt ſink or ſwim for them; only this God is thy portion, will <hi>never leave thee nor forſake thee,</hi> Hebr. 13.5. O how happy wouldſt thou be in having ſuch a friend! Thy portion would be tied to thee in this life, as <hi>Dionyſius</hi> thought his kingdome was to him, with chains of Adamant; there would be no ſevering it from thee. The world could not; thou ſhouldſt live above the world whilſt thou walkeſt about it, and behave thy ſelf in it not as its champion but conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; <hi>He that is born of God, overcometh the world,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.9. Satan ſhould not part thee and thy por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; thy God hath him in his chain; and though, like a Maſtiffe without teeth, he may bark, yet he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bite or hurt his children: <hi>I have written unto you young men, becauſe ye have overcome the wicked one,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.13. Nay it ſhould not be in thine own power to ſell away thy portion; thou wouldeſt be a <hi>joynt heir with Chriſt;</hi> and co-heirs cannot ſell, except both joyn; and Chriſt knoweth the worth of this inheritance too well to part with it for all that this beggarly world can give. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. The Apoſtle makes a challenge, which men nor devils could never accept or take up; <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt? ſhall tribulation, or diſtreſs, or perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, or famine, or nakedneſs, or ſword? nay in all theſe things we are more then conquerours through him that loves us, Rom.</hi> 8.35, 36, 37, 38. Nay, at death thy portion would ſwim out with thee in that ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack: death, which parts all other portions from men, will give thee full poſſeſſion of thine: Then, and not till then, thou ſhouldſt know what it is worth; yea even at the great day, the fire which ſhall burn up
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:100701:102"/> the world, ſhall not ſo much as ſinge thy portion; thou mightſt ſtand upon its ruines and ſing, <hi>I have loſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, I have my portion, my inheritance, my happineſs, my God ſtill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Other portions, like <hi>ſummer-fruit,</hi> are <hi>ſoon ripe,</hi> and <hi>ſoon rotten;</hi> but this portion, like <hi>winter fruit,</hi> though it be longer before the whole be gathered, yet it will continue. Gold and ſilver, in which other mens portion lieth, are <hi>corruptible;</hi> but thy portion, like the body of Chriſt, <hi>ſhall never ſee corruption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When all earthly portions, as meat over-driven, certainly corrupts; or as water in ciſterns quickly groweth unſavoury: this portion, like the water in <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> his well, is not capable of putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>O Friend, what are all the portions in the world (which, as a candle, conſume in the uſe, and then go out in a ſtink) to this eternal portion! It is reported of one <hi>Theodorus,</hi> that when there was muſick and feaſting in his Fathers houſe, withdrew himſelf from all the company, and thus thought with himſelf, <hi>Here is content enough for the fleſh; but how long will this laſt? this will not hold out long:</hi> then falling on his knees, <hi>O Lord, my heart is open unto thee. I indeed know not what to ask but only this, Lord, let me not die eternally: O Lord, thou knoweſt I love thee, O let me live eternally to praiſe thee.</hi> I muſt tell thee, Reader, to be eternally happy, or eternally miſerable; to live eternally, or to die eternally, are of greater weight then thou art aware of; yea of far more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment then thou canſt conceive: Ponder this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive therefore throughly. God is not only a <hi>ſatisfying</hi> portion, filling every crevis of thy ſoul with the light
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:100701:102"/> of joy and comfort, and a <hi>ſanctifying</hi> portion eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thy ſoul to its primitive and original perfection, and an <hi>univerſal</hi> portion; not health, or wealth, or friends, or honours, or liberty, or life, or houſe, or wife, or childe, or pardon, or peace, or grace, or glory, or earth, or heaven, but all theſe and infin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tely more; but alſo he is an <hi>eternal</hi> portion. <hi>This God would be thy God for ever and ever, Pſal.</hi> 48.11. O ſweet word <hi>Ever!</hi> thou art the crown of the Saints crown, and the glory of their glory; their portion is ſo <hi>full,</hi> that they deſire no more; they enjoy variety and plenty of delights above what they are able to ask or think, and want nothing, but to have it <hi>fixt;</hi> may they but poſſeſs it in peace without interruption or ceſſation, they will trample all the Kingdomes of the earth as dirt under their feet; and loe thou art the welcome <hi>Dove</hi> to bring this <hi>olive branch</hi> in thy mouth, <hi>This God is our God for ever and ever.</hi> All the Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical figures of dayes, and months, and years, and ages, are nothing to this infinite <hi>Cypher, ever,</hi> which though it ſtand for nothing in the vulgar account, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains all our millions; yea our millions and millions of millions are leſſe then <hi>drops</hi> to this <hi>Ocean Ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If all the pleaſures of the whole creation cannot countervail the fruition of God, though but for <hi>one moment,</hi> how happy ſhouldſt thou be to enjoy him <hi>for ever!</hi> If the firſt fruits and foretaſts of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians felicity be ſo raviſhing, what will the harveſt be? Friend, little doſt thou think what <hi>crowns, ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, palmes, thrones, kingdomes, glories, beauties, banquets, angelical entertainments, beatifical viſions, ſocieties, varieties, and eternities</hi> are prepared for them who chuſe God for their portion. If the Saints
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:100701:103"/> croſſe in the judgement of <hi>Moſes</hi> (when at age, and able to make a true eſtimate of things) were more worth then all the treaſures of <hi>Egypt</hi> (and he choſe it rather) what is the Saints crown, eternal crown worth?</p>
               <p>To conclude this Uſe, Reader, take a ſerious view of this portion which is here tendered to thee, and conſider upon what eaſie termes it may be thine for ever. The portion is no leſſe then the infinite God; <hi>Behold the nations are as a drop of the bucket, and are counted as the ſmall duſt of the ballance; all nations before him are as nothing, and they are counted to him leſſe then nothing and vanity, Iſai.</hi> 40.15, 17. Other portions are <hi>bodily;</hi> he is <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> and ſo <hi>ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> to thy ſoul. Other portions are <hi>mixt,</hi> like the Iſraelites pillar, which had a dark as well as a light ſide; but he is <hi>pure;</hi> there is not the leaſt <hi>ſpot</hi> in this <hi>Sun;</hi> he is a <hi>ſea</hi> of ſweetneſs without the ſmalleſt <hi>drop</hi> of gall. Other portions are <hi>particular;</hi> there are ſome chinks in the outward man which they cannot fill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the many leaks of the ſoul, none of which they can ſtop; but he is an <hi>univerſal</hi> portion. All the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of the creatures, even when their dregs and imperfections are removed, are but dark ſhadows of thoſe many ſubſtantial excellencies which are in him; He made <hi>all,</hi> he hath <hi>all,</hi> he is <hi>all;</hi> the moſt fluent tongue will quickly be at a loſſe in extolling him, for he is <hi>above all bleſſing and praiſes.</hi> Other portions are <hi>debaſing,</hi> like droſſe to gold, an allay to its worth: but he is an <hi>advancing</hi> portion, as a ſet of Diamonds to a royal Crown, infinitely adding to its value. Other portions are <hi>periſhing;</hi> they may be loſt, they will be left when death calls; thy cloth will be
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:100701:103"/> then drawn, and not one diſh remain on the table; but he is an <hi>everlaſting</hi> portion; the ſouls that feaſt with him (like <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> at <hi>Davids</hi>) eat bread at his table <hi>continually; In his preſence is fulneſs of joy, and at his right hand are pleaſures for evermore.</hi> Now is not here infinite reaſon why thou ſhouldſt chooſe this God for thy portion?</p>
               <p>Conſider the <hi>termes</hi> upon which he is willing to be thy portion; he deſires no more then thou wouldſt <hi>take him for thy treaſure</hi> and happineſs. Surely ſuch a portion is worthy of <hi>all acceptation.</hi> Be thy own Judge; may not God expect, and doth he not deſerve as much reſpect as thine earthly portion hath had? Can thy eſteem of him be too high, or thy love to him be too hot, or thy labour for him too great? O what warm embraces haſt thou given the world? throw that ſtrumpet now out of thine armes, and take the faireſt of ten thouſand in her room. What high thoughts haſt thou had of the world? what wouldſt thou not formerly do or ſuffer to gain a little more of it? Now pull down that Uſurper out of the throne, and ſet the King of Saints there, whoſe place it is; eſteem him ſuperlatively above all things, and make it thy buſineſs, whatſoever he call thee to do or ſuffer, to gain his love, which is infinitely better then life it ſelf. Do but exalt him in thy heart as thy chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good, and in thy life as thine utmoſt end, and he will make a deed of gift of himſelf to thee. Is it not rational what he deſires? why ſhouldſt thou then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe?

                  <p>Some obſerve that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> mourned longer (for they mourned 70 dayes) for old <hi>Jacobs</hi> death, then <hi>Joſeph</hi> his own Son; and the reaſon is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they <hi>had hopes only in this life,</hi> when <hi>Joſeph</hi> knew that as his fathers body was carried to the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo his Soul was tranſlated to the heavenly <hi>Canaan.

                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſtian, what is it in death that thou art afraid of? Is it not a <hi>departure,</hi> the <hi>Goal delivery</hi> of a long priſoner, the <hi>ſleep</hi> of thy body, and a <hi>wakening</hi> of thy Soul, the <hi>way</hi> to bliſs, the <hi>gate</hi> of life, the <hi>portall</hi> to Paradiſe? Art thou not ſure to triumph before thou fighteſt, by dying to overcome death, and when thou leaveſt thy body, to be joyned to thy head? The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> general in the encounter between <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Hannibal,</hi> thought he could not uſe a more effectual perſwaſion to encourage his ſouldiers then to tell them <hi>that they were to fight with thoſe whom they had formerly overcome, and who were as much their ſlaves as their enemies.</hi> Thou art to enter the liſt againſt that adverſary whom thou haſt long agoe conquered in Jeſus Chriſt, and who is more thy ſlave then thine
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:100701:107"/> enemy. <hi>Death is thine,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.30. thy ſervant and ſlave, to help off thy cloaths, and to put thee to thine everlaſting happy reſt.</p>
                  <p>Is it the taking down of thine earthly tabernacle which troubles thee? Why, Doſt thou not know that death is the workman ſent by the Father to pull down this <hi>earthly houſe of mortality</hi> and clay, that it may be ſet up a new, infinitely more laſting, beautiful and glorious? Didſt thou believe how rich and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did he intends to make it (which cannot be unleſſe taken down) thou wouldſt contentedly endure the preſent toyl and trouble, and be thankful to him for his care and coſt. He takes down thy <hi>vile body,</hi> that he may faſhion it like to the <hi>glorious body of his own Son,</hi> which for brightneſs and beauty excels the Sun in its beſt attire, far more then that doth the meaneſt Star.</p>
                  <p>Is it the untying of the knot betwixt body and ſoul which perplexeth thee? It is true they part; but as friends going two ſeveral wayes ſhake hands till they return from their journey; they are as ſure of meeting again, as of parting; for thy ſoul ſhall return laden with the wealth of heaven, and fetch his old companion to the participation of all his joy and happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Is it the rotting of thy body in the grave that grieves thee? Indeed <hi>Plato</hi>'s worldling doth ſadly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail it: <hi>Woe is me, that I ſhall lie alone rotting in the earth amongſt the crawling Wormes, not ſeeing ought above, nor ſeen!</hi> But thou who haſt read it is a ſweet bed of ſpices for thy body to reſt in, all the dark night of this worlds duration, mayſt well baniſh ſuch fears. Haſt thou never heard God ſpeaking to thee as once to <hi>Jacob, Fear not to goe down into</hi> (Aegypt,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:100701:107"/> into) <hi>the grave, I will go down with thee, and I will bring thee up again.</hi> Gen. 16.4.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, thy Soul ſhall never die. The heathen Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian could comfort himſelf againſt death, with this weak cordial, <hi>Non omnis moriar, All of me doth not die; though my body be mortal, my books are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal.</hi> But thou haſt a ſtronger julip, a more rich cordial to clear thy ſpirits; when thy <hi>body</hi> failes, thy <hi>ſoul</hi> will flouriſh; thy death is a <hi>burnt offering;</hi> when thy aſhes fall to the earth, the celeſtial flame of thy Soul will mount up to Heaven. Farther, death will eaſe thee of thoſe moſt troubleſome gueſts, which make thy life now ſo burdenſome; as the fire to the three children, did not ſo much as <hi>ſinge</hi> or ſear their <hi>bodies,</hi> but it <hi>burnt</hi> and conſumed their <hi>bands:</hi> ſo death would not the leaſt <hi>hurt</hi> thy body or ſoul, but it would deſtroy thoſe <hi>fetters</hi> of <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>ſorrow,</hi> in which thou art intangled:<note place="margin">Nazian.

Popiſh Pilgrims take tedious journeys, and are put to much hardſhip and expence to behold a dumb Idol.
